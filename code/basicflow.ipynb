The Company has \\nestablished management committees, including those focused \\non risk, that support management in carrying out its governance and risk management responsibilities. One type of management committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-making body that operates for a particular purpose and may report to a Board committee. \\nEach management governance committee, in accordance \\nwith its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging \\nTable 14: Board and Management-level Governance Committee Structure risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues as appropriate. \\nTable 14 presents, as of December\\xa031, 2021, the structure \\nof the Companyâ€™s Board committees and management governance committees reporting to a Board committee, including relevant reporting and escalation paths. \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nAudit \\nCommittee (1) Finance \\nCommittee Corporate\\nResponsibility\\nCommittee Risk \\nCommittee Governance & \\nNominating\\nCommittee Human \\nResources \\nCommittee \\nManagement Governance Committees \\nDisclosure \\nCommittee Capital \\nManagement\\nCommittee Allowance for Credit \\nLosses Approval \\nGovernance \\nCommittee Enterprise Risk &\\nControl Committee Incentive \\nCompensation \\nand \\nPerformance \\nManagement\\nCommittee \\nRegulatory and\\nRisk Reporting\\nOversight\\nCommittee Corporate \\nAsset/Liability\\nCommittee Risk and Control \\nCommittees \\nRecovery and\\nResolution \\nCommittee Risk Type \\nCommittees \\nRisk Topic \\nCommittees \\n(1) The Audit Committee additionally oversees the internal audit function; external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and the disclosure framework for financial, regulatory and risk reports prepared for the Board, management, and bank regulatory agencies; and assists the Board in its oversight of the Companyâ€™s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \\nManagement Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk Committee of the Board. The Enterprise Risk & Control \\nCommittee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to the Companyâ€™s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management regarding current and emerging risks and senior managementâ€™s assessment of the effectiveness of the Companyâ€™s risk management program. \\nThe ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its \\nmembership is comprised of principal line of business and certain enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also escalates certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with the Companyâ€™s escalation management policy. \\nEach principal line of business and enterprise function has a \\nrisk and control committee, which is a management governance committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its scope limited to the respective principal line of business or enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. \\nAs a complement to these risk and control committees,', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",
