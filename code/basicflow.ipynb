Over 400 million people have been infected with the virus, almost 6 million people have died, and so many others have been impacted in diferent ways. At the same time, we are learning to coexist with COVID-19. We now have multiple vaccines and a clearer understanding of how to protect ourselves from infection. \\nWells Fargo has used its strength to provide support \\nthrough this crisis to our employees, customers, and communities, and we will continue to do so. We recognize that the pandemic has left many people in need, and that those needs haven’t gone away. As a company, we will continue to provide support to a diverse set of stakeholders over the long term. \\nAlongside these eforts, the work we have been doing \\nto transform Wells Fargo has made us an even stronger company than we were a year ago. It has put us in a position to support a broad set of stakeholders, and it has positively impacted our results.

       " Document(page_content='Financial performance \\nThe work we have been doing to improve our financial profile is beginning to impact our results. In 2021, Wells Fargo generated $21.5 billion in net income, or $4.95 per common share. This included a $5.7 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses which improved earnings by $1.05 per common share. \\nOur revenue increased 6% from the \\nprevious year, with lower net interest income more than ofset by growth in noninterest income. We benefted from strong gains in our afliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains from the sales of our student lending, asset management, and corporate trust businesses, which we do not expect to repeat in 2022. But we also had broad-based revenue growth across our businesses, including in Home Lending, Consumer & Small Business Banking, credit cards, Auto lending, Commercial Real Estate, investment banking, and Wealth & Investment Management.   \\nExpenses declined 7% from a year ago, \\nrefecting lower operating losses and progress on our efciency initiatives – and this is while we added to our investments to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure and made other investments to build out new products and capabilities for our customers. \\nCredit quality improved signifcantly \\nas we saw strong economic growth and our customers had high levels of liquidity. Our net charge-of rate declined from 35 basis points in 2020 to 18 basis points in 2021, and, as noted above, our allowance for credit losses declined by $5.7 billion. \\nLoans outstanding increased 1% \\nfrom a year ago. Loans declined in the frst half of the year but grew 5% in the second half, with growth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Average deposits in 2021 grew $61.8 billion, or 4%, from a year ago as declines in commercial deposits, driven by our actions to remain under the asset cap, were more than ofset by growth in consumer deposits. \\nWe also returned a significant \\namount of capital to our shareholders, $16.9 billion in total. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share in the third quarter and then to $0.25 in the first quarter of 2022. In total, we returned $2.4 billion through common stock dividends in 2021 and repurchased $14.5 billion of common stock, predominantly in the second half of 2021, after the return to the stress capital bufer framework. \\nOur return on equity was 12.0% and \\nour return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 14.3%, which is close to our stated goal of about 15% over time ¹. \\nExcluding the reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 2021, ROTCE would have been 11.2%². In addition, we had several other items which benefted our results, such as very strong equity gains, extremely low charge-of rates, and the \\n1.

We said at the beginning of 2021 that we see a clear path to achieving a sustainable 10% ROTCE, and we believe we will achieve that, subject to the same assumptions we’ve discussed in the past, on a run rate basis at some point in 2022. We have also said that after achieving this, we will target approximately 15% sustainable ROTCE. We continue to believe that our franchise is capable of producing signifcantly higher returns, and we remain focused on achieving them while continuing to invest in our infrastructure and in our capabilities to serve our customers. \\nThe strong economy continues \\nto positively impact our customers and our results  Consumers’ fnancial position remained strong throughout the pandemic. While median deposit balances declined during the second half of 2021, after Economic Impact Payments ended, consumers continued to have more liquidity than prior to the pandemic, with median balances at the end of the year 26% higher than pre-pandemic levels.  \\nConsumer credit card spend continued \\nto be strong, with general purpose credit card spending up 27% in 2021 compared with 2020 and up 17% from pre-COVID 2019 levels. The spending categories most impacted by COVID in 2020 – travel, fuel, and entertainment – all rebounded by more than 50% in 2021. Across all sectors, travel was the only one that was still down from 2019 levels; however, travel spending improved throughout 2021 and nearly doubled from 2020 levels. \\nConsumer debit card spend also \\ncontinued to be strong, with spending up 20% compared with 2020 and up 28% from 2019 levels. All spending categories increased in 2021, except for a modest decline in food and drug. Discretionary spending on retail goods continued to be strong relative to both 2020 and 2019 as customer liquidity levels remained high. \\nWhile loan demand was weak early \\nin the year, loans grew 5% in the second half with growth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. We saw strong growth in auto and also had strong loan growth in Corporate & Investment Banking, with loans up 16% from a year ago. \\nWe have made significant progress \\nover the past two years I’ve been at the company for a little over two years and believe we are a very different company today than when I arrived. Though we have much more to do, overall, I feel great about what we’ve accomplished in an incredibly difcult operating environment. \\nI think about our areas of progress along \\nseveral dimensions: \\n• Risk, control, and regulatory • Talent and leadership • Financial and strategic progress • ESG and company reputation • Customer centricity \\n2021 Annual Report IV', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Risk, control, and regulatory \\nWe began a process two years ago to change the culture and priorities of the company. The most signifcant part of this was prioritizing the development and implementation of an appropriate risk and control framework across the company. Our approach to managing this is entirely diferent than when I arrived, and I believe we are making signifcant progress. We are laser-focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators. We work to have clear plans in place and clear owners for each regulatory deliverable we have. We have detailed reporting on how we’re progressing on those plans. We review this reporting weekly at the Operating Committee. Our executives are expected to be actively engaged in the details and are accountable for getting the work done properly and timely.  \\nOur ability to identify risk and control issues has also improved from two years ago. We have reached numerous regulatory milestones over the past year. These include: \\n• The OCC’s January 2021 termination of a 2015 consent order related to the company’s \\nBank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) compliance program \\n• The September 2021 expiration of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) consent \\norder issued in 2016 regarding the bank’s retail sales practices \\n• The OCC’s January 2022 termination of a consent order issued in June 2015 regarding add-on \\nproducts that the company sold to retail banking customers before 2015  \\nDespite reaching these milestones, we still have much more work to do. We need to implement \\nthe many plans we have developed, some of which contain several years’ worth of work, and also demonstrate their sustainability. We have multiple checkpoints along the way before we turn the completed work over to our regulators for their review. All of this takes time. An additional complexity is the number of issues and consent orders we are working through simultaneously, which translates into both a high volume of work and a high amount of interdependencies across multiple streams of work. We strive to complete the work accurately and timely, and while we continue to improve our execution, we don’t always meet all of our goals. \\nThe reality is that while I feel good about our progress since I joined the company, many of the \\nconsent orders that remain open have been outstanding for too long. Wells Fargo has been too slow in building and implementing appropriate risk and control frameworks, and the company has been too slow in addressing legacy issues. As a result, in September 2021, the OCC assessed a fne and imposed a new consent order related to loss mitigation activities in our Home Lending business and insufcient progress in addressing requirements under a consent order the agency issued to us in 2018. \\nUntil our broad book of risk, control and regulatory work is complete, we remain at risk for setbacks. \\nHaving said that, I remain confdent in our ability to continue to close our remaining gaps over the next several years. We are committed to completing the work, and I believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in place will enable us to get the work done. \\nV', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Talent and leadership \\nWe have a new management team running Wells Fargo. Since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019, 11 of 16 Operating Committee members are new to the company. Additionally, well over half of the senior most people at our company, meaning those who are one level below the Operating Committee, are new to their roles, and a signifcant proportion of them were hired from outside the company. This is a dramatic change in our leadership and to the group of people responsible for driving the cultural and process changes required for our transformation. We have recruited highly qualifed people with experience in their areas of expertise and have promoted talented leaders within Wells Fargo. \\nWe’ve also signifcantly changed how we run the company. We have regular detailed \\nbusiness reviews, we prioritize resources across the entire company, and we ensure that we diferentiate the performance of our people, rewarding strong performers and coaching those who need to improve. We expect people to prioritize what’s right for our customers, we value execution, and we embrace direct conversations that push us to improve. We celebrate our success but focus on what we can do to improve. \\nFinancial and strategic progress \\nAfter a strategic review in 2020 that resulted in the sale or reductions of several of our businesses, we are making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We are just now beginning to bring to market diferentiated products and services. The number of signifcant opportunities ahead is exciting, but we are only at the beginning of building the culture necessary to transform how we compete in today’s world. \\nI can’t say it enough – job one has been and will continue to be building and implementing \\nan appropriate risk and control infrastructure across the company, embedding changes in our culture, and doing the work with urgency. But we are also investing in our strategic positioning. \\nThough our market shares remain strong, we have been slow in improving and \\nexpanding our capabilities to compete with the best banks and non-banks across all of our businesses. This is changing. All of our lines of business have signifcant opportunities to meaningfully grow, and we are investing in long-term plans to move our franchise forward. There is more competition than ever before, but I continue to feel great about our competitive position and energized about the opportunities in front of us.  \\nConsumer digital \\nAn example is our consumer mobile platform. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced a rebuilt mobile banking experience for Consumer & Small Business customers, and we began rolling it out in the frst quarter of 2022. It has a new, modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs. Though digital adoption has been \\nVI \\n2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='increasing – in the fourth quarter our customers \\nlogged in 1.6 billion times using a mobile device, up 7% year over year, and teller transactions remained more than 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels – we believe that an improved platform can drive signifcantly higher digital adoption from our customers. \\nWe also announced that later this year we will \\nbe adding an all-new virtual assistant – named “Fargo” – to our mobile app. Customers will be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions and ask Fargo to complete a task for them. Fargo will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their fnances. \\nWe also introduced the frst phase of the \\nredesign of our public website early this year. \\nIn addition, we are beginning to become more \\nactive in creating new digital solutions on the wholesale side of our business. For example, we announced that we are collaborating with HSBC to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchain-based solution, which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs. \\nCards and payments \\nWe are approaching payments and credit cards very diferently. We believe credit cards will remain important as both a credit and payment vehicle and are investing in our capabilities. We are also doing additional work around non-card payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key fnancial services provider. \\nTwo years ago, our credit card products \\nand capabilities were not as competitive as necessary. In 2021, we launched two new credit card products, including Active Cash\\nSM, \\nwhich has been referred to as the best cash back card in the marketplace, and Reflect\\nSM, \\nwhich rewards customers for on-time payments. We improved the core credit card experience, including investing in advertising, simplifying our digital application, and enhancing our underwriting and customer service. These eforts have driven an increase in digital card activation and enrollment in paperless statements and alerts. We are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were before launching these products, and importantly, we are not competing on credit. In fact, the credit quality of applications and accounts we are now booking is consistently stronger than what we were booking prior to launch. \\nAway from card, we are investing in digital \\npayments across the platform, enhancing our capabilities, increasing limits, and broadly reducing the friction in moving money. As evidence, Zelle momentum continued to accelerate in 2021, with Zelle transactions up 56% year over year, and Zelle dollar volume up 66%. In the fourth quarter alone, Zelle dollar volume increased 12% from the prior quarter. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending and \\nWealth & Investment Management We have one of the strongest consumer franchises in the largest consumer fnancial services market in the world. The strength of the franchise is still incredible when you consider the stresses that the past several years have placed on the industry and our company. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending \\nWe serve approximately 64 million consumer banking and lending customers, and our bank branch footprint remains a competitive advantage. We have nearly 4,800 retail bank branches, with a presence in 25 of the largest 30 markets in the U.S. ³ A Wells Fargo branch \\nor ATM is within 2 miles of over half of U.S. Census households and small businesses in our footprint. In parallel, as consumers increasingly shift their banking transactions to digital \\n3.

       " Document(page_content='channels, in 2021 we had 33 million \\ndigital active customers, up 3% from 2020, and we had 27.3 million mobile active users, up 5% from 2020. \\nFull year 2021 average deposits \\nin Consumer Banking and Lending totaled $834.7 billion, up from $722.1 billion a year earlier. For full year 2021, we had $471.5 billion in debit card purchase volume, up 20% from $391.9 billion in 2020, and 9.8 billion debit card purchase transactions, up 12% from 8.8 billion in 2020. \\nIn our Home Lending businesses, \\nwe had $205 billion in total originations in 2021, down from $222.7 billion in 2020, driven by an increase in rates and a drop in application volume. Credit card point-of-sale volume was $102.5 billion in 2021, up 26% from $81.6 billion in 2020, in part driven by the launch of our new credit card products. We originated $33.9 billion in auto loans in 2021, up 49% from $22.8 billion in 2020. While auto loan originations have benefted from enhancements we’re making to our capabilities, we continue to be cautious about the increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so and have maintained our underwriting standards. \\nWealth & Investment \\nManagement (WIM) Our WIM business has over 12,300 advisors who serve 2.8 million clients. At the end of 2021, total client assets reached a record $2.2 trillion, up 9% from $2.0 trillion in 2020, primarily due to higher market valuations. We have worked over the past year to simplify our go-to-market strategy within WIM and are investing in our independent and digital channels to complement our existing capabilities. Those eforts will continue into 2022. \\nTaking a step back and looking \\nbroadly across our consumer businesses, we have been focused for several years in consumer banking and lending on remediating sales practices issues. This has been a must. But we have been slow to develop new products, segment our customer base, and develop tailored oferings for each. We still have great opportunity to drive digital adoption to further our eforts to become more efcient and target diferent customers. And we have signifcant opportunities to integrate our consumer businesses across our wealth, consumer lending, and payments oferings. \\nOur belief is that we have the key \\ningredients to compete and be the primary provider for fnancial services for the consumer. Being the primary provider for payments is critical for the mass consumer base, and our deposit, lending and investment products round out our oferings. For the more afuent, our wealth and lending capabilities are critical, and deposits and payments round out those offerings. How we deliver these capabilities is critical – in our branches, on our mobile app, on our native browser, via telephone, and in person. Our capabilities have to be diferentiated by customer segment. \\nWe have the resources to take this \\nintegrated approach, and to build the best consumer platform – but to do this we need to work across our individual consumer businesses, which we have not always done historically. \\nVIII 2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The boundaries between our lines of business are necessary to bring relevant expertise to bear, \\nbut these boundaries are artifcial and cannot stand in the way of making us approach the customer holistically. Like most banks, we have historically delivered our products and services based on how we were organized – not how the customer has wanted to work with us. This is changing and will allow us to compete diferently than we have in the past. \\nCommercial Banking and Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) \\nWe manage Commercial Banking and Corporate & Investment Banking as separate lines of business, but they ofer many of the same products and should share capabilities with common platforms. Here too we are looking past artifcial boundaries. We are combining Treasury Services platforms, and we are working with commercial clients to ofer CIB products such as foreign exchange, interest rate swaps, access to public markets, and M&A advisory services.  \\nWe have great market positions in both lines of business and have meaningful opportunities to \\ngrow. \\nIn Commercial Banking, we serve three core segments: emerging middle-market, middle market \\nand mid-corporate companies. We have over 5,000 bankers and a presence in 49 of the largest 50 markets in the country ⁴. Commercial Banking total loans were $190.3 billion at the end of \\n2021. Deposit growth in Commercial Banking was strong, with average deposits of $197.3 billion in 2021, up 10% from $178.9 billion in the prior year. \\nCIB has been a core part of the company for many years. We have been, and will remain, \\ndisciplined in where we compete, and we continue to grow our business not by changing our risk profle, but by leveraging our core relationships and delivering the entire enterprise to these clients. In 2021, this approach led to growth in banking revenue, up 4% year over year (YoY) to $5.1 billion, primarily driven by higher advisory and debt origination fees, as well as higher loan balances. Broadly speaking, we continue to be focused on leveraging our balance sheet commitments to drive relationships, diversifying our business mix in Capital Markets, and continuing to grow our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) business. Our CRE business is the largest commercial real estate lender in the U.S., and its 2021 revenue was up 10% YoY, to nearly $4 billion. \\nAs we look to grow our business across both Commercial Banking and CIB, we are focused on digital, \\nincluding building out our digital platforms on both the front and back ends. This extends beyond combining our two Treasury Services platforms. It includes a payments modernization program for fnancial institution clients, as well as Integrated Receivables, which we launched last year to simplify payment and remittance data capture, re-association and invoice matching. We are also focused on increasing investment banking revenue from Middle Market clients. \\nTechnology \\nAt the heart of our ability to compete over the long term will be a diferent approach to technology. We think about this along two dimensions. \\n4. Based on Core-Based Statistical Areas \\nIX', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='First is creating a platform-based, API-driven architecture that enables similar banking \\nservices to be used across diferent products. Instead of building large applications as we have in the past, this API-driven architecture relies on a nimble set of smaller applications that provide common features and customer data across products and services. It’s a “once built, many times consumed” approach. This won’t happen all at once, but we have a clear path ahead. Over time, our presence will evolve to this model, improving customer experience and allowing us to get new products and services to market more quickly. \\nAs a foundation to this, our Digital Infrastructure Strategy, which we announced in 2021, \\narticulates our approach to moving toward cloud-enabled applications, initially using both public and private cloud solutions and also migrating to a set of modern data centers that will host our private cloud platforms. \\nSecond is a technology-frst approach to our businesses. This is a material change \\nfrom our approach today. We compete with fntech companies where engineers who understand products also design solutions for customers. Wells Fargo, like many other banks, often develops a solution and then asks engineers to build it. We are moving toward an agile approach to development to bring our teams much closer and speed up timelines to get to market. \\nAll of this is good progress, but it’s not enough. As I’ve said before, we need to move from \\nan approach where technology aids our business to where technology drives our business. This is a tough journey, but without it, we signifcantly reduce our chances of success. \\nESG and company reputation \\nWe believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders – in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. Our history has shown this to be true. Consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation. A strong reputation is achieved not just from strong fnancial performance, but from actively supporting employees, customers, and communities – especially those most in need. \\nWe have supported our employees consistently through the pandemic, which I wrote \\nabout at some length in my letter to you last year. In November 2021, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefts and competitive pay to our employees, we would provide supplemental pay from October 2021 to the end of January 2022 to eligible branch employees in active status, in recognition of their contributions during the pandemic. We also announced an increase in U.S. minimum hourly pay levels to a range of $18-22, based on role, location, and market conditions. Over a five-year time period, from 2017-2021, we increased average wages for U.S. hourly employees by nearly 25%. Over the same time period, we increased our investment in U.S. employee benefts by over 20%. \\nX \\n2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We have also undertaken significant \\neforts to support consumers and small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic. We supported the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by funding roughly 280,000 loans totaling approximately $14 billion, working with clients of all sizes to provide fexibility and assistance where needed. In addition, we extended forbearance options for over 1 million mortgage customers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nAfter the CARES Act was signed into law, \\nthe government paid fees to those who administered PPP loans. Our belief was that these funds were best used to help small businesses stay open and support employment during the pandemic – not to support our bank. COVID-19 caused a crisis in our communities, not a financial crisis, and we were happy to use our resources to support PPP without fee compensation in 2020. In July 2020, we announced Open for Business, a $420 million fund we created with the gross processing fees we would have earned from processing PPP loans we funded in 2020. We created Open for Business to give back to communities, particularly small businesses, with a focus on those in underserved areas. Wells Fargo has worked with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and local nonprofts across the nation to distribute funding, and to ensure funding occurs at a highly local level. While our work on PPP focused on smaller small businesses most in need, we needed partners to access the broadest set of small businesses in need to facilitate our Open for Business program. \\nWe fulflled our Open for Business commitment \\nin 2021, donating $420 million to organizations that support small businesses during both 2020 and 2021. Our total philanthropic giving in 2021, including both Open for Business dollars and Wells Fargo Foundation giving, was $615 million. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and we have a role to play working with our clients to transform their businesses to carbon-friendly models. Last year we announced our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, including fnanced emissions, by 2050. We also increased our sustainable fnance commitment to $500 billion between 2021 and 2030. In May 2021, we issued our frst sustainability bond, raising $1 billion in capital to support housing afordability, socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, and renewable energy. We expect to announce our first interim fnanced emissions targets for the oil and gas, and power sectors later this year. \\nThis work is bigger than any one company, \\nand we will work across companies and industries as we progress. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an industry-led leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning their fnancing with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. \\nFinally, we recognize that afordable housing \\ncontinues to be one of the top needs in our country. As a company, we use our resources to support afordable, multifamily housing in the U.S., in addition to acting as an active lender for affordable rental housing developments. We remain committed to supporting our customers with homeownership. In 2021, we helped over 585,000 homeowners with new low-rate loans to either purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage. We also closed $2.2 billion in new commitments for afordable housing under the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs. As part of our NeighborhoodLIFT program, we committed to invest $5 million to help more than 300 low-and moderate-income residents in Houston with home down payment assistance. \\nXI', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Customer centricity \\nWe believe that we must be customer-centric in how we approach our products and services. Our work to advance our digital and mobile presence, to take an agile approach to product development, and to rethink our technology infrastructure are examples of how we’re working to improve the customer experience. \\nBeing customer-centric is not only \\nabout customer experience, though. It’s more fundamentally about how we price and deliver for our customers and meet their fnancial needs. \\nIn January 2022, we announced \\nnew eforts that will roll out over the course of the year to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover short-term cash needs. We are eliminating transfer fees for customers enrolled in Overdraft Protection, eliminating non-sufcient funds fees, giving early access to direct deposit by providing customers access to funds up to two days before a customer’s scheduled deposit, and adding a 24-hour grace period for customers who overdraw their account to cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee. In addition, this year we will introduce a new short-term credit product for customers to meet personal fnancial needs. \\nThese changes build on services that \\nWells Fargo had introduced previously. Clear Access Banking, which we introduced in September 2020, is a consumer bank account that charges no overdraft fees. It now has over 1.1 million outstanding customer accounts. Overdraft Rewind, which was introduced in 2017, automatically reverses overdraft fees when a covering direct deposit is received by the next morning. The service will be replaced with the 24-hour grace period I mentioned above. Wells Fargo also sends more than 1.3 million balance alerts every day to help customers avoid overdrafts. \\nPutting all of our changes in perspective, \\nthese fees are down signifcantly since the fnancial crisis. We have alternatives for both customers that do not want overdraft protection and those that do. This is a competitive marketplace, and we continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customers. Our Office of Consumer Practices, an internal, consumer-focused advisory group that we launched in January 2021, is involved in this work, and plays an important role in helping ensure our products, services, and business practices are fair and transparent. \\nCompetition and what it means for us \\nOur competition is stronger than ever. We compete against some outstanding banks of all sizes. We compete with younger non-banks that have specialized in one part of our business, many of which have moved on to compete more broadly. We also compete with non-banks that have signifcant market capitalizations, and big tech continues to expand its reach into the fnancial services proft pool. \\nSo why do I feel so excited to be at \\nWells Fargo? Simply put, our capabilities allow us to serve consumers and companies with better products at a better value than most anyone else. \\n2021 Annual Report XII', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

If we don’t change \\nhow we approach our customers, our company will go through a process of slow and steady decline. Others have approached the customer diferently and are competing more efectively. For too long, Wells Fargo has: \\n1. Allowed others to build their businesses of of years and years of our investments. These include \\ncompanies that hav e built payments technology and services using bank-developed and supported \\nACH, credit cards, and debit cards. \\n2. Developed products that are designed around how we are organized, not how the customer wants \\nto be serv ed by us. For instance, our deposit, lending, investment, and payments products have not \\nhistorically been on an integrated platf orm. \\n3. Not created user interfaces that are competitive with the best experiences in the marketplace. \\nIn addition, there is a perception that banks do not innovate so regulation should allow these smaller technology focused companies to compete without being subject to the same oversight as regulated banks. \\nWhile others have done well, I still believe that the game is ours to lose. Our customer relationships are \\nextremely valuable, and we remain in a great position to continue to be their primary fnancial services provider, but we must approach their needs diferently. We’ve begun to do that, and I’ve referenced some of these changes earlier in this letter. But there’s more to do. \\nAs we look forward \\nOur game plan remains the same: build a strong risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a company of our size and complexity, run a disciplined business with talented people who remain excited by what Wells Fargo does for its employees, customers and communities, invest for the long term but continue to improve our fnancial performance each year, and realign our business with a technology-frst and true customer-centric viewpoint. \\nWe are unwavering in our commitment to build a strong risk and control foundation. We are committed \\nto invest what’s necessary and continue to do this work with the sense of urgency necessary for our most important priority. But we also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements – with setbacks likely to continue along the way – and will continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us. \\nWe will continue to embrace our responsibility to our employees, customers and communities. I commented earlier that we believe we will achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE – subject to the same \\nassumptions we’ve discussed in the past – on a run rate basis at some point this year, and that once we’ve achieved this goal, we will discuss our plan to continue to increase returns.

Wells Fargo ranked No. 37 on Fortune’s\\xa0 2021 \\nrankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at December\\xa031, 2021.\\xa0\\nWells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which could be significant.

       " Document(page_content='Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on April\\xa08, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received by the Company from loans made in connection with these programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to nonprofit organizations approved by the FRB that support small businesses. As of December\\xa031, 2021, the Company had not excluded these exposures from the asset cap. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. The Company has not yet satisfied certain aspects of the consent orders, and as a result, we believe regulators may impose additional penalties or take other \\nWells Fargo & Company 2', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

In addition, the consent order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is provided. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters and Other Customer Remediation Activities \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to \\nidentify other areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and implement additional operational and control procedures. We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the probable and estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust efforts, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. \\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters and other customer remediation activities, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nRecent Developments \\nCOVID-19 Pandemic In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of essential services to the public. We have taken comprehensive steps to help customers, employees and communities. \\nWe have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain \\nfocused on delivering for our customers and communities to get through these unprecedented times. PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, \\nand Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans guaranteed under a program called the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). We funded approximately $14.0 billion in loans under the PPP. At December\\xa031, 2021, we had $2.4 billion of PPP loans outstanding. We voluntarily committed to donate all of the gross processing fees received from PPP loans funded in 2020. In 2021, we fulfilled this approximately $420 million commitment. \\nLIBOR Transition \\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='LIBOR Transition \\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely \\nreferenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. Additionally, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts. \\nIn preparation for the cessation of the various LIBOR \\nsettings, we have undertaken a variety of activities. Among other things, we proactively implemented internal “stop-sell” dates to discontinue offering products referencing LIBOR except pursuant to limited exceptions consistent with regulatory guidance. At the same time, we expanded our suite of product offerings that are indexed to alternative reference rates. \\nWe also continue to transition our legacy LIBOR contracts to \\nalternative reference rates. We transitioned substantially all of our legacy contracts with LIBOR settings impacted by the December 31, 2021, cessation date to alternative reference rates, and we will continue to address contracts with LIBOR settings that are impacted by the June 30, 2023, cessation date. • For USD LIBOR contracts that mature before June 30, 2023, those contracts that are renewed or replaced will be indexed to alternative reference rates. \\n• At December 31, 2021, the notional amount of our derivatives indexed to USD LIBOR, including bilateral contracts that mature after June\\xa030, 2023, and centrally-cleared contracts that mature either before or after June 30, 2023, was over $6 trillion. We expect substantially all of these contracts to transition to SOFR either prior to or immediately after June 30, 2023, in accordance with existing fallback provisions. \\n• At December 31, 2021, we had over $350 billion of USD LIBOR commercial credit facilities that mature after June 30, 2023. These contracts generally do not contain appropriate fallback provisions.

Substantially all of these debt securities contain fallback provisions and are expected to transition to an alternative reference rate immediately after June 30, 2023. \\nAdditionally, we continue to monitor legislative \\ndevelopments that would provide a statutory framework to \\nreplace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. \\nFor information regarding the risks and potential impact of \\nLIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced, or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section in this Report. \\nCapital Matters \\nEffective October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, the Company’s stress capital buffer used to determine our minimum risk-based capital requirements under the Standardized Approach became 3.10%. Beginning January 1, 2022, our global \\nsystemically important bank (G-SIB) capital surcharge decreased by 50 basis points from 2.00% to 1.50%. \\nEffective January 1, 2022, we are required to use the \\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) for calculating exposure amounts for credit risk-weighted assets (RWAs) on derivative contracts. The adoption of SA-CCR resulted in an increase of less than 1.00% in total RWAs under the Standardized Approach (which was our binding approach at December 31, 2021) and a decrease of less than 0.50% in total leverage exposure at January 1, 2022. \\nOn January 25, 2022, the Board approved an increase to the \\nCompany’s first quarter 2022 common stock dividend to $0.25\\xa0per share. For additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section in this Report. \\nBusiness Divestitures \\nOn November 1, 2021, we closed our previously announced agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services business and our previously announced agreement to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM). We recorded net gains of $674 million and $269\\xa0million, respectively, from these sales, which are subject to certain post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions. \\nFinancial Performance \\nIn 2021, we generated $21.5 billion of net income and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.95, compared with $3.4\\xa0billion of net income and EPS of $0.43 in 2020. Financial performance for 2021, compared with 2020, included the following: • total revenue increased due to higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income; \\n• provision for credit losses decreased reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment, which led to lower charge-offs and better portfolio credit quality; \\n• noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating losses, restructuring charges, and professional and outside services expense, partially offset by higher incentive and revenue-related compensation in personnel expense; \\n• average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding originations in our residential mortgage loan portfolio, weak demand for commercial loans, and the reclassification of student loans (included in other consumer loans) to loans \\nheld for sale (LHFS); and', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='held for sale (LHFS); and \\n• average deposits increased driven by growth in the Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating segments due to higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer and commercial customers reflecting government stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of payment deferral programs on consumer customers, partially offset by actions taken to manage under the asset cap which reduced deposits in the Corporate and Investment Banking operating segment and Corporate. \\nIn second quarter 2021, we retroactively changed the \\naccounting for certain tax-advantaged investments. These \\nchanges had a nominal impact on net income and retained earnings on an annual basis and did not impact historical trends or business drivers. Prior period financial statement line items have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Prior period risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, including the financial statement line items impacted by these changes, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCapital and Liquidity \\nWe maintained a strong capital position in 2021, with total equity of $190.1\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $185.7\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2020. Our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios remained strong at December\\xa031, 2021, including: • our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.35% under the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which continued to exceed both the regulatory requirement of 9.60% and our current internal target; \\n• our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.03%, compared with the regulatory requirement of 21.50%; and \\n• our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 118%, which continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%. \\nSee the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” \\nsections in this Report for additional information regarding our capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory capital and liquidity amounts. \\nCredit Quality \\nCredit quality reflected the improving economic environment. • The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of $13.8\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2021, decreased $5.9 billion \\nfrom December\\xa031, 2020. \\n• Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(4.2) billion in 2021, down from $14.0 billion in 2020.

Net income increased in 2021, compared with 2020, due to a $18.3\\xa0billion decrease in provision for credit losses, a $8.4\\xa0billion \\nincrease in noninterest income, and a $3.8\\xa0billion decrease in \\nnoninterest expense, partially offset by a $6.7 billion increase in \\nincome tax expense, a $4.2\\xa0billion decrease in net interest \\nincome, and a $1.4 billion increase in net income from noncontrolling interests. \\nFor a discussion of our 2020 financial results, compared with \\n2019, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2020. \\nNet Interest Income \\nNet interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. \\nNet interest income and the net interest margin in any one \\nperiod can be significantly affected by a variety of factors including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in \\n2021, compared with 2020, due to the impact of lower interest \\nrates, lower loan balances reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of our student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization, partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. Net \\ninterest income in 2021 included interest income from PPP loans of $518\\xa0million. Additionally, in 2021, we had interest income associated with loans we purchased from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization pools of $1.1\\xa0billion. For additional information about loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in this Report. \\nTable 3 presents the individual components of net interest \\nincome and the net interest margin.

The effective income tax rate for 2021 reflected the impact of higher pre-tax income while the effective income tax rate for 2020 reflected both the impact of income tax benefits (including tax credits) on lower pre-tax income and income tax benefits related to the resolution and reevaluation of prior period matters with U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The income tax expense (benefit) and our effective income tax rate for both years reflected the impact of changes in accounting policy for certain tax-advantaged investments adopted in second quarter 2021. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nOperating Segment Results \\nOur management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see Table 7. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income \\nWells Fargo & Company 12', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

In March 2021, we announced an agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services business and, in second quarter 2021, we moved the business from the Commercial Banking operating segment to Corporate. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. These changes did not impact the previously reported consolidated financial results of the Company. On November 1, 2021, we closed the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and WFAM. \\nIn second quarter 2021, we elected to change our \\naccounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments and elected to change the presentation of investment tax credits related to solar energy investments. These accounting policy changes had a nominal impact on reportable operating segment results. Prior period financial statement line items for the Company, as well as for the reportable operating segments, have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Our LIHTC investments are included in the Corporate and Investment Banking operating segment and our solar energy investments are included in the Commercial Banking operating segment. For additional information, see the “Overview – Recent Developments” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment’s use of capital. \\nSelected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results. Management believes that these metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable operating segments or lines of business.', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \\nIn the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial \\ntransactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. \\nCommitments to Lend \\nWe enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because a significant portion of these commitments are not funded. For additional information, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Entities \\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with securitization transactions and are considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. Guarantees and Other Arrangements \\nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCommitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities \\nWe enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional information, see Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nDerivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments.

       " Document(page_content='Risk Management \\nWells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly \\naffect our financial performance and our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders. \\nRisk is Part of our Business Model. Risk is the possibility of an \\nevent occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \\nto achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model risks, and strategic and reputation risks. \\nRisk Profile. The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \\naggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \\nbusiness activities after taking into consideration risk management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \\nRisk Capacity. Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \\nthe Company could assume given its current level of resources \\nbefore triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital and liquidity needs. \\nRisk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk \\ncapacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current \\nlevel of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \\nRisk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \\nCompany’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \\nCompany’s most significant opportunities and challenges, develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in the strategic planning process, which is closely linked with the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s evaluation. \\nRisk and Climate Change. The Company is committed to helping \\nmitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities \\nand to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. Risk is Managed by Everyone. Every employee, in the course of \\ntheir daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nRisk and Culture. Senior management sets the tone at the top \\nby supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions.

       " Document(page_content='by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board holds senior management \\naccountable for establishing and maintaining this culture and for effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to the Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations. \\nRisk Management Framework. The Company’s risk \\nmanagement framework sets forth the Company’s core \\nprinciples for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by \\nbuilding an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We continue to enhance our risk management programs, including our operational and compliance risk management as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s April 20, 2018, consent orders. \\nRisk Governance \\nRole of the Board. The Board oversees the Company’s business, \\nincluding its risk management. It assesses senior management’s performance and holds senior management accountable for maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management program. \\nBoard Committee Structure. The Board carries out its risk \\noversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. \\nThe Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk management framework and oversees management’s implementation of the framework, including how the Company manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation.

The Enterprise Risk & Control \\nCommittee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management program. \\nThe ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its \\nmembership is comprised of principal line of business and certain enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also escalates certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with the Company’s escalation management policy. \\nEach principal line of business and enterprise function has a \\nrisk and control committee, which is a management governance committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its scope limited to the respective principal line of business or enterprise function.

At December\\xa031, 2021, approximately $1.1\\xa0billion of unpaid principal balance related to residential mortgage loans, excluding those insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), remained in a deferral period. \\nBased on guidance in the CARES Act and the Interagency \\nStatement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)  issued by federal banking regulators in April 2020 (the \\nInteragency Statement), both of which we elected to apply, loan modifications related to COVID-19 and that meet certain other criteria are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) classification. The TDR relief provided by the CARES Act guidance is no longer available after January 1, 2022; however, certain COVID-related lending accommodations may continue to \\nbe eligible for TDR relief under the Interagency Statement. At December\\xa031, 2021, the majority of residential mortgage loans that were in a deferral period, excluding those that were government insured/guaranteed, met the criteria for TDR relief and were therefore not classified as TDRs. \\nCustomers who were current prior to entering the deferral \\nperiod and confirmed their ability to return to their contractual loan payments upon exiting the deferral period will remain on accrual status. Customers who are unable to resume making their contractual loan payments upon exiting the deferral period are generally placed on nonaccrual status until they perform for a period of time. Such customers may require further assistance after exiting from these deferral programs and may receive or be eligible to receive modifications, or may be charged-off in accordance with our policies.

The change was driven by decreases in the oil, gas and pipelines, retail, transportation services, and entertainment and recreation industries, as these industries continue to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nThe majority of our commercial and industrial loans and \\nlease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of repayment. \\nThe portfolio increased at December\\xa031, 2021, compared \\nwith December\\xa031, 2020, driven by higher loan demand resulting \\nin increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness.

Interest-only loans were approximately 3% of total loans at both December\\xa031, 2021, and December\\xa031, 2020. We believe our origination process appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our residential mortgage loans and our ACL for loans considers this risk.

These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to 30 years.\\xa0We continuously monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan is delinquent. \\nOur residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior \\nlien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options available during the draw period of (1)\\xa0interest-only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest.

       " Document(page_content='to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a \\nfixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30\\xa0years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30\\xa0years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. \\nIn anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit \\nborrowers reaching the end of their contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. \\nWe monitor changes in real estate values and underlying \\neconomic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of large numbers of properties in a short period of time using market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of an individual property may vary significantly from the average for the market area. We have processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when AVMs may be used.

The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to impact the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and may result in increases or decreases in our ACL. \\nWe believe the ACL for loans of $13.8\\xa0billion at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) who include the mortgage loans in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. \\nIn connection with our sales and securitization of residential', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",

See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. \\nWe provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage \\nloans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms of these programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our exposure to loss related to these programs. \\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors.\\n The loans we service were originated by us or by other \\nmortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4)\\xa0maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements.

However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the securitization market. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations. \\nEach agreement under which we act as servicer or master \\nservicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. For additional information on the OCC consent order, see the “Overview” section in this Report. \\nAsset/Liability Management \\nAsset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. \\nAt the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability \\nCommittee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a \\nfinancial intermediary for customers based on investments such as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. We are subject to interest rate risk because: • assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; \\n• assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; \\n• short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently; \\n• the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or \\n• interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. \\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 30, \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 30: • Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities. \\n• Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant. \\n• Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. \\n• Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding products could impact expected net interest income. \\n• Deposit rates paid may change with market interest rate changes. Our interest rate sensitivity of deposits, referred to as deposit betas, is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio. The actual deposit rates paid may differ from the assumed deposit rates paid in these scenarios due to lags in repricing and other factors. \\n• We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios. \\nWells Fargo & Company 49', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

For the simulations with downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00% interest rate floor limits the amount of the decline in net interest income. We may have a larger decline in net interest income when interest rates increase for the base scenario relative to the interest rate floor. \\nThe sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest \\nincome or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite direction of our net interest income. Mortgage originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates and generally increase in response to lower interest rates, particularly refinancing activity. Mortgage banking results are also impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for additional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from \\nchanges in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, our trading assets are (before the effects of certain economic hedges) generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities. As a result, net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest rates rise and fall, respectively. The impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate exposures.

The notional or contractual amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, are presented in Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: • to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and • to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK\\xa0 We', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nWe typically originate agency residential mortgage loans as \\nheld for sale and certain prime non-agency residential mortgage loans as held for investment. Occasionally, we designate some of our agency residential mortgage loans as held for investment and non-agency residential mortgage loan originations as held for sale in support of future issuances of private label residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). We issued $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion of RMBS in 2021 and 2020, respectively. \\nInterest rate and market risk can be substantial in our \\nmortgage businesses. Changes in interest rates may impact origination and servicing fees, the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants, as well as the associated income or loss in mortgage banking noninterest income, including the gains or losses related to economic hedges of MSRs and LHFS. Given the time it takes for customer behavior to fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will generally affect our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis. The amount and timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest rates. \\nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \\nsubjective and involve complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently unpredictable. See the “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional information. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements. For additional information on mortgage banking, including key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking \\nActivities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the \\npropensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the servicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand, which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \\nresidential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest rate options. MSR hedging results include a combination of directional gain or loss due to market changes as well as any carry \\nWells Fargo & Company 50', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

Carry income \\nrepresents accretion from the forward delivery price to the spot price including both the yield earned on the reference securities and the market implied cost of financing during the period. A steep yield curve generally produces higher carry income while a flat or inverted yield curve can result in lower or potentially negative carry income. \\nThe size of the hedge and the particular combination of \\nhedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Because market factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio and the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our mortgage businesses change continually, the types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. \\nHedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage \\nbanking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged. \\nMARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and impairment of private equity investments. \\nThe Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk matters to the Risk Committee. \\nAt the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk \\nManagement function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for market risk. The Market and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into the CRO and provides periodic reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee. \\nMARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading \\nactivities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense components of our consolidated statement of income.

For additional information on the financial instruments used in our trading activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \\nestimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management function aggregates and monitors all exposures to ensure risk measures are within our established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and legal entity. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation model which assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the potential future outcomes and measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on average once every 100 trading days. \\nAverage Company Trading General VaR was $49\\xa0million for \\nthe year ended December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $123 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2020. The decrease in average Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, was driven by market volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular changes in interest rate curves and a significant widening of credit spreads exiting the 12-month historical look-back window used to calculate VaR. \\nWells Fargo & Company 51', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",

The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly \\ncorrelated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days. \\nSensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR \\nmodels, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves. \\nStress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to \\nadverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, \\nstress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These scenarios assume that the market moves happen instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). \\nAn inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \\nhistorical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis addresses how these events might affect the risk factors relevant to a portfolio. \\nThe Company’s stress testing framework is also used in \\ncalculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in this Report. \\nMARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",

Because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, is 3.10%. \\nAs a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule \\nimplementing an additional capital surcharge of between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. Our G-SIB capital surcharge decreased by 50 basis points to 1.50% beginning in first quarter 2022. \\nUnder the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \\nand credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). Effective January 1, 2022, we are required by federal \\nbanking regulators to use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) for calculating exposure amounts for credit RWAs on derivative contracts. SA-CCR replaced the current exposure method for calculating these exposure amounts for purposes of our risk-based capital ratios and our supplementary leverage ratio. The adoption of SA-CCR resulted in an increase of less than 1.00% in total RWAs under the Standardized Approach (which was our binding approach at December 31, 2021) and a decrease of less than 0.50% in total leverage exposure at January 1, 2022. \\nThe Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and \\ntier 1 capital, along with RWAs, are fully phased-in.

Accordingly, we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio that is 100 basis points above our regulatory requirement plus an incremental buffer of 25 to 50 basis points. Our capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, including changes to the regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. \\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells\\xa0Fargo.

The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Furthermore, in order to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for effective senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks. \\n• Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank \\nAct established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance. \\n• Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities . The \\nDodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally-registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, as well as others adopted or under consideration by regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities.', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 81}),\n",

For additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable to us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. \\n“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \\nRules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. In addition to the Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. On June 29, 2021, we submitted our most recent resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 82}),\n",

Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented.

For example, in order to facilitate the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), federal banking regulators issued rules designed to encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus measures, such as the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity and the functioning of markets, including facilities covering money market mutual funds and term asset-backed securities loans. Certain of these measures, including the acceptance of applications under the Paycheck Protection Program and the extension of credit under certain FRB lending facilities, ended in 2021.

       " Document(page_content='Critical Accounting Policies\\xa0\\nOur significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: • the allowance for credit losses; \\n• the valuation of residential MSRs; \\n• the fair value of financial instruments; \\n• income taxes; \\n• liability for contingent litigation losses; and \\n• goodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit \\nCommittee. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nWe maintain an ACL for loans, which is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFor loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured \\nbased on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. \\nChanges in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \\nfor credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considerations include the evaluation of past events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nJudgment is specifically applied in: \\n• Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period.

       " Document(page_content='Judgment is specifically applied in: \\n• Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to \\nestimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real estate prices. Quarterly, we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. \\n• Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term \\naverage loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n• Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. Individually \\nassessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. \\n• Usage of credit loss estimation models. We use internally \\ndeveloped models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses. Management uses a combination of judgment and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are validated in accordance with the Company’s policies by an internal model validation group. We routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against the company-wide risk inventory to help ensure that we appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed. \\n• Valuation of collateral . The current fair value of collateral is \\nutilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously written-down below current recovery value. \\n• Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual \\nterm of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension \\nWells Fargo & Company 65', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n",

Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. \\n• Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s \\njudgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nSensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key \\nassumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by management. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, and general economic conditions. General economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables, which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. \\nOur sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s \\nview of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We applied 100% weight to the downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration from a COVID-19 resurgence. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately $4.4 billion at December\\xa031, 2021. The hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. \\nThe sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities \\nand other financial assets given its size relative to the overall ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date.\\xa0\\nValuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) \\nMSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from third parties. We also have acquired MSRs in the past under co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. \\nWe carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans \\nat fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are reflected in earnings. \\nWe use a model to estimate the fair value of our \\nresidential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and require judgment to determine. If observable market indications do become available, these are factored into the estimates as appropriate: • The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future net servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \\n• The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of \\nreturn investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). \\n• The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes \\nestimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market participant's view for our estimated cost to service and our actual costs may vary from that estimate. \\nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \\nand generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and \\nmortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards, as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value estimate to independent appraisals. \\nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. \\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value \\nadjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS debt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments, such as certain LHFS, a majority of nonmarketable equity securities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments due to application of lower-of-cost-or-market \\nWells Fargo & Company 66\", metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

We also disclose our estimate of fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as loans held for investment or issuances of long-term debt. \\nThe accounting requirements for fair value measurements \\ninclude a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. \\nWhen developing fair value measurements, we maximize the \\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that generally use market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internal models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. \\nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs, \\nmanagement judgment is necessary as we make judgments about significant assumptions that market participants would use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of many factors, including market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market participant would require in light of the illiquid market. \\nWe continually assess the level and volume of market \\nactivity in our debt and equity security classes in determining adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions can change over time, our determination of which securities markets are considered active or inactive can change.

Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding of information currently available related to the legal evaluation and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management. These matters may be in various stages of investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was not considered or was considered remote in anticipated occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. \\nThe outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject \\nto significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. \\nSee Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for additional information. \\nGoodwill Impairment \\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in market capitalization. \\nWe identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill \\nimpairment at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using both an income approach and a market approach and are intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as well as external market conditions. The methodologies for calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are periodically assessed by senior management and revised as necessary. \\nThe income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) \\nanalysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our lines of business. Significant assumptions include future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and assumptions related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, we incorporate a terminal value estimate based on an assumed long-term growth rate. We discount these forecasted cash flows using a rate derived from the capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity specific to that reporting unit, which reflects risks and uncertainties in the financial markets and in our internally generated business projections. \\nThe market approach utilizes observable market data from \\ncomparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in the selection of comparable companies and includes those with the most similar business activities. \\nThe aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our \\nmarket capitalization for our fourth quarter 2021 assessment. Factors that we considered in our assessment and contributed to this difference included: (i) an overall premium that would be paid to gain control of the operating and financial decisions of the Company, (ii) synergies that we believe may not be reflected in the price of the Company’s common stock, (iii) a higher degree of complexity and execution risk at the Company level, compared with the individual reporting unit level, and (iv) risks or benefits at the Company level that may not be reflected in the fair value of the individual reporting units. \\nBased on our fourth quarter 2021 assessment, there was no \\nimpairment of goodwill at December 31, 2021. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a substantial amount. \\nDeclines in our ability to generate revenue, significant \\nincreases in credit losses or other expenses, or adverse actions from regulators are factors that could result in material goodwill impairment in a future period. \\nFor additional information on goodwill and our reportable \\noperating segments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 10 (Intangible Assets), and Note 26 (Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWells Fargo & Company 68', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

The Update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholder's life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair value. The cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value upon adoption of the Update, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the earliest period presented and will affect our regulatory capital calculations. At December\\xa031, 2021, our estimated liability related to these guaranteed minimum benefits was approximately $500 million and was associated with approximately $13.1\\xa0billion of policyholder account values. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions. We plan to economically hedge the market volatility, where feasible. Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs are not expected to be material. \\nOther Accounting Developments \\nThe following Updates are applicable to us but are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements: • ASU 2020-06 – Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity \\n• ASU 2021-05 – Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases \\nwith Variable Lease Payments \\n• ASU 2021-08 – Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers \\n• ASU 2021-10 – Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance \\nWells Fargo & Company 69\", metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

These businesses have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest or disturbances, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the U.S. economy.

If unemployment levels worsen\\xa0or if home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit products, including our mortgages, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings.', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n",

In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively affect the performance of products we have provided to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our trading activities and venture capital businesses.

We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged low interest rate environment as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. \\nChanges in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread \\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates – could also reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve flattens, or even inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the FRB. \\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \\nour earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based on changes in interest rates. \\nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \\nis always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions, as', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n",

A downgrade of the sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition. \\nAs noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our \\nfunding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our liquidity. In addition, actions taken to manage under the asset cap may continue to impact our ability to retain deposits. \\nIf we are unable to continue to fund our assets through \\ncustomer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an intra-day or intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected.

Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs.

When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. \\nFuture allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \\nvariety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December\\xa031, 2021, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions worsen.

In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet.

For example, there have been and could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information security breaches. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover critical business processes or operations that have been disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our customers. \\nAs a result of financial institutions and technology systems', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 98}),\n",

Information security risks for large financial \\ninstitutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, software, networks, and our customers’ devices are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks or other information security breaches, which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures and inappropriately circumvents controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. \\nDue to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of \\nfinancial institutions and technology systems, an information security incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole.

       " Document(page_content='security breaches remains heightened because of, among other things, the persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the current global economic and political environment. For example, Wells\\xa0Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as their third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity and other information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses associated with an information security breach. \\nCyber attacks or other information security breaches \\naffecting us or third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nOur framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in \\nmitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework \\nseeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others.

       " Document(page_content='management framework, there are inherent limitations to our \\nrisk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the inability to align performance management and compensation to achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed to risks if we do not accurately or completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise, or if an employee fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other misconduct. In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and predict risks, such as market, interest rate and credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and \\nassess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could result in ineffective risk management practices, business decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our business decisions and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or accurately predict future events or exposures. Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, build and maintain robust risk management policies and practices.\\xa0If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nWe may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory \\nproceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to retail sales practices and other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm.

Various government entities \\nand offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016, and various non-governmental parties filed lawsuits against us seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. The Company has entered into various settlements to resolve these investigations and proceedings, as a result of which we have incurred monetary penalties, costs, and business restrictions. If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. \\nFurthermore, we have and may in the future identify other \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including as a result of our continuing efforts to rebuild trust and to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure. For example, we have identified certain issues related to past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection waiver or insurance agreements. The identification of such other areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, and in some cases has already resulted in, additional remediation costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences. \\nFor additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales \\nPractices Matters and Other Customer Remediation Activities” section and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative \\nconsequences from regulatory violations or from any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations.\\xa0 We maintain', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. \\nWells Fargo and other financial institutions have been \\ntargeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, which have included disrupting the operation of our retail banking locations, and have been subject to negative public commentary, including with respect to the fees charged for various products and services.

Accomplishing these business plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require significant financial, technological, management and other resources, may divert management attention and resources away from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses and ability to generate revenue.

To the extent we are unable to develop or execute effective business plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of operations may be adversely affected. \\nIn addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest \\ncertain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets. \\nSimilarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our \\nproducts, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, \\nWells Fargo & Company 82', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 101}),\n",

Time and resources spent on integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the acquired company or business operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations and/or employees. \\nOur operations and business could be adversely affected by the \\nimpacts of climate change. The physical effects of climate \\nchange, including the increased prevalence and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions regarding climate change, could also require us to change certain of our business and/or risk management practices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if we are unable to achieve our objectives or if our response is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient.

We are one of the largest mortgage originators \\nand residential mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus the fair value of our MSRs. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Changes in interest rates can also negatively affect the fair value of certain residential mortgage loans within LHFS and other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations. For example, similar to other interest-bearing securities, if market interest rates increase relative to the yield on these residential mortgage LHFS and other interests, their fair value may fall. \\nWhen rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually \\ntends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates. \\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \\nour mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. \\nWe rely on the GSEs to guarantee or purchase mortgage \\nloans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy requirements. In order to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs or government insuring agency standards, which are referred to as “nonconforming” loans. We generally retain these \\nWells Fargo & Company 83', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 102}),\n",

When we retain a \\nloan on our balance sheet not only do we keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could be used to generate new loans. If we were unable or unwilling to retain nonconforming loans on our balance sheet, whether due to regulatory, business or other reasons, our ability to originate new nonconforming loans may be reduced, thereby reducing the interest income we could earn from these loans. Similarly, if the GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate new mortgage loans, could also be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” sections in this Report. \\nWe may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse \\nconsequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to the residential mortgage loans we originate or service.  In \\norder to reduce credit risk and obtain additional funding, from time to time we may securitize or sell mortgage loans that we originate. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements under which we sell mortgage loans that we originate or in the insurance or guaranty agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that reflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant additions to the repurchase liability. \\nAdditionally, for residential mortgage loans that we \\noriginate, we could become subject to monetary damages and other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or regulations. \\nFurthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for \\nthe mortgage loans we service, we may face a number of consequences, including termination as servicer or master servicer, requirements to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us to perform our servicing obligations, and/or contractual obligations to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing income.', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 103}),\n",

In addition, we may continue to be subject to fines, business restrictions, and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our servicing of flood zone properties. Any of these actions may harm our reputation, negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or servicing business, or result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other enforcement actions. \\nFor additional information, see the “Overview,” “Risk \\nManagement – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities,” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” sections and Note 14 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCOMPETITIVE RISKS \\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly \\nevolving financial services industry. We compete with other \\nfinancial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customer relationships and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. \\nContinued technological advances and the growth of \\ne-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other \\nWells Fargo & Company 84', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 103}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. \\nWe may not respond effectively to these and other competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to sell products at lower prices, increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing products and services, and/or develop new products and services to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To the extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new products and services or responding or adapting to the competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we may lose customer relationships and our revenue growth and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical \\nto the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is \\nheavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, capital markets, risk management and technology, the competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, effectively manage employee performance and development, and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same compensation limitations. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, including successors for senior leadership positions, our business performance, competitive position and future prospects may be adversely affected. \\nFINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS \\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards, and \\nchanges in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.  Our accounting policies are fundamental \\nto determining and understanding our financial results and condition. As described below, some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies could materially affect our financial statements. \\nFrom time to time the FASB and the SEC change the \\nfinancial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, also retroactively, in each case potentially resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. For additional information, see the “Current Accounting \\nDevelopments” section in this Report. \\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Developments” section in this Report. \\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and \\nestimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future, and our financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting.\\xa0 Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are \\nrequired to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For a description of these policies, see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. \\nCertain of our financial instruments, including derivative \\nassets and liabilities, debt securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment, and there is no assurance that our models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant inputs required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings. \\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires \\nour management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. In addition, our customers may rely on the effectiveness of our internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be “independent” of us under SEC rules, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences. \\n*\\xa0 *\\xa0 * \\nWells Fargo & Company 85', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",

We provide banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50\\xa0states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells\\xa0Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the financial services industry. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including: • allowance for credit losses (Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses)); \\n• valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities)); \\n• valuations of financial instruments (Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)); \\n• liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 15 (Legal Actions)); \\n• income taxes; and \\n• goodwill impairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. Change in Accounting Policies \\nIn second quarter 2021, we elected to change our accounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the investments are carried at amortized cost and amortized in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized in income tax expense. Previously, we recognized the amortization of the investments in other noninterest income and the related tax impacts were recognized in income tax expense. We determined that the proportional amortization method is preferable because it better aligns the financial statement presentation with the economic impact of these investments, which generate tax credits over the lives of the investments. Adoption of the proportional amortization method was applied retrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by $448\\xa0million as of January 1, 2019. \\nIn second quarter 2021, we also elected to change the', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In second quarter 2021, we also elected to change the \\npresentation of investment tax credits related to solar energy investments, which are accounted for under the deferral method. We reclassified the investment tax credits on our consolidated balance sheet from accrued expenses and other liabilities to a reduction of the carrying value of the investment balances. We also reclassified the investment tax credits, which are recognized over time, from income tax expense to interest income for solar energy leases or noninterest income for solar energy equity investments. We determined that this presentation is preferable because it better reflects the financial statement presentation of the investment tax credits as an integral component of the investments. The change in accounting policy was adopted retrospectively to January 1, 2019. \\nTable 1.1 presents the impact of the accounting policy \\nchanges for LIHTC investments and solar energy investments to our consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheet.

Trading assets and \\nliabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for sale, derivatives and short sales, which are reported within our consolidated balance sheet based on the accounting classification of the instrument. In addition, debt securities that are held for investment purposes that we have elected to account for under the fair value method, are classified as trading. \\nOur trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net gains on trading and securities within noninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in net interest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading activities include our \\nactions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments and market-making activities. We also take positions to manage our exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold financial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short positions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the purchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the anticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an offsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure to the customer transaction. We earn income based on the transaction price difference between the customer transaction and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded. \\nOur market-making activities include taking long and short \\ntrading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These activities are typically executed on a short-term basis. As a market-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference between the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the positions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading positions held on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we may enter into separate derivative or security positions to manage our exposure related to our long and short trading positions taken in our market-making activities. Income earned on these market-making activities are reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded. \\nDebt Securities \\nOur investments in debt securities that are not held for trading purposes are classified as either debt securities available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity (HTM). \\nInvestments in debt securities for which the Company does \\nnot have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as AFS. AFS debt securities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in cumulative other comprehensive income (OCI).

       " Document(page_content='INTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION Unamortized \\npremiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the effective interest method, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the next call date using the effective interest method. As principal repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. \\nWe recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \\nsecurities in net gains on trading and securities within noninterest income using the specific identification method. \\nIMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt \\nsecurities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of debt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations for certain types of AFS debt securities include: • Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, including federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government. \\n• Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are most impacted by changes in the relationship between municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. \\n• Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also impacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets underlying the security. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we \\nhave the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized in net gains on trading and securities within noninterest income equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis, net of ACL, and the fair value of the AFS debt security. Following the recognition of this impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost basis is fair value. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in earnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the extent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies relating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt securities classified as HTM. \\nTRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES  Upon \\ntransfer of a debt security from the AFS to HTM classification, the amortized cost is reset to fair value adjusted for any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model. Unrealized gains or losses at the transfer date continue to be reported in cumulative OCI. The cumulative OCI balance is amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized premiums and discounts using the effective interest method. Any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model is reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re-established. The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are recorded in provision for credit losses. \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES We \\ngenerally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors similar to those described for loans.

Subsequent to charge-off, the debt security will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process described above for any cash received. \\nSecurities Purchased and Sold Agreements \\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. We monitor the fair value of securities purchased and sold as well as the collateral pledged and received. Additional collateral is pledged or returned to maintain the appropriate collateral position for the transactions. These financing transactions do not create material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring process. We include securities sold under repurchase agreements in short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. At December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, short-term borrowings were primarily comprised of securities sold under repurchase agreements. \\nLoans Held for Sale \\nLoans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes commercial and residential mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. We have elected the fair value option for a majority of residential LHFS (see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)). The remaining residential LHFS are held at the lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) and are measured on a pool level basis. \\nCommercial LHFS are generally held at LOCOM and are \\nmeasured on an individual loan basis. We have elected the fair value option for certain commercial loans included in LHFS that are used in market-making activities for our trading business. \\nGains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage \\nLHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest income. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net gains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are recognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are recognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. Interest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income. \\nWhen a determination is made at the time of commitment \\nto originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic review under our management evaluation processes, including corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent changes occur, including changes in interest rates, our business strategy, or other market conditions, we may change our intent to hold these loans. When management makes this determination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS portfolio at LOCOM. Loans \\nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. \\nUnearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 118}),\n",

If the ultimate collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan to zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, interest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received. Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the terms of the loan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. \\nWe may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a \\nrestructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to the modification).

These modified terms may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, if applicable. For modifications where we forgive principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. If the underwriting for a TDR modification did not include an evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay, the loan is deemed collateral dependent. Other than resolutions such as foreclosures, sales and transfers to held-for-sale, we may remove loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan. \\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS AND OTHER RELIEF RELATED \\nTO COVID-19  The  Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) and the  Interagency Statement on Loan \\nModifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with \\nCustomers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)  issued by federal \\nregulators in April 2020 (the Interagency Statement) provide optional, temporary relief from accounting for certain loan modifications as TDRs. Based on guidance in the CARES Act and Interagency Statement, modifications related to the adverse effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that meet certain criteria are exempt from TDR classification. Additionally, we elected to apply the lease modification relief provided by the FASB for leases accounted for under ASC 842, Leases , that were\", metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

During 2021, we continued to apply the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act and Interagency Statement for eligible COVID-related residential mortgage loan modifications. The TDR relief provided by the CARES Act guidance is no longer available after January 1, 2022; however, certain COVID-related lending accommodations may continue to be eligible for TDR relief under the Interagency Statement. \\nFor COVID-related modifications in the form of payment \\ndeferrals or payment forbearance, delinquency status will not advance and loans that were accruing at the time the relief is provided will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status during the deferral period. Interest accrued during payment deferrals or payment forbearance may be included in the principal balance of the loans and charge-offs will generally be based on delinquency status after the loan exits the deferral or forbearance period. \\nFORECLOSED ASSETS  Foreclosed\\xa0assets obtained through our \\nlending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans have been written down to their net realizable value prior to foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is recorded with a charge to the ACL at foreclosure. We allow up to 90 days after foreclosure to finalize determination of net realizable value. Thereafter, changes in net realizable value are recorded to noninterest expense. The net realizable value of these assets is reviewed and updated periodically depending on the type of property. Certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure are included in accounts receivable, not foreclosed assets. These receivables were loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are measured based on the balance expected to be recovered from the FHA or VA. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nThe ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for AFS and HTM debt securities, other financing receivables measured at amortized cost, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. While we attribute portions of the allowance to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios), loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer) or major security type, the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nOur ACL process involves procedures to appropriately \\nconsider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset classes, portfolio segments, and major security types. For each loan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt security type, losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities with similar risk characteristics. For loans and securities that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, the losses are estimated individually, which generally includes our \\nWells Fargo & Company 100', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

For AFS debt securities, losses are estimated at economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables \\nthe individual security level. which will create volatility as those variables change over time. \\nOur ACL amounts are influenced by a variety of factors, See Table 1.3 for key economic variables used for our loan \\nincluding changes in loan and debt security volumes, portfolio portfolios. \\nTable 1.3: Key Economic Variables \\nLoan Portfolio Key economic variables \\nTotal commercial • Gross domestic product \\n• Commercial real estate asset prices, where applicable \\n• Unemployment rate \\nResidential mortgage • Home price index • Unemployment rate \\nOther consumer (including credit card, auto, and other consumer) • Unemployment rate \\nOur approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses \\nfor loans and debt securities includes the following key components: • An initial loss forecast period of two years for all portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects management’s expectation of losses based on forward-looking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by management to estimate future credit losses. \\n• Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast period. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n• The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension options. We also incorporate any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a TDR. Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. \\n• Utilization of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to measure credit impairment for loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring, unless they are collateral dependent and measured at the fair value of the collateral. The DCF methods obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the initial and historical mean loss forecast periods described above. \\n• For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the ACL, which incorporate expected credit losses using the conceptual components described above. For most HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss model, similar to the methodology used for loans. \\nThe ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \\nvaluation account that is deducted from, or added to, the', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \\nvaluation account that is deducted from, or added to, the \\namortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. When credit expectations change, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported in provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off are subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a negative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was previously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot have an associated negative allowance. \\nFor certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \\nloans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. Treasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not recognized an ACL as our expectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis, based on historical losses, adjusted for current and forecasted conditions, is zero. \\nA financial asset is collateral-dependent when the borrower \\nis experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. When a collateral-dependent financial asset is probable of foreclosure, we will measure the ACL based on the fair value of the collateral. If we intend to sell the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the collateral’s net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell). In most situations, based on our charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial real estate or other business assets. \\nWe do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest \\nreceivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we include an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are neither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan is 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans. \\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  \\nGenerally, commercial loans, which include net investments in lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the event of default, considering the quality of any underlying \\nWells Fargo & Company 101', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

Probability of default, loss severity at the time of \\ndefault, and exposure at default are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default within each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as appropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted economic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit commitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to derive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated probability of default and loss severity at the time of default are applied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments. \\nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  For \\nconsumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer portfolio. \\nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for \\nqualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES  Our off-balance sheet \\ncredit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally in the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated \\nfor expected credit losses. These other financial assets include accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts receivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss expectation (for example, government guarantee) or no historical credit losses. Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Given the nature of these financial assets, provision for credit losses is not recognized separately from the regular income or expense associated with these financial assets. \\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are generally \\nover-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short-term in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these financial assets. \\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \\nFinancial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \\nLeasing Activity \\nAS LESSOR  We lease equipment to our customers under \\nfinancing or operating leases. Financing leases are presented in loans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-party investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual lease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The residual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales price for the equipment at lease termination based on sales history adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. Many of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at prevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at lease termination. \\nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers \\nboth the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as the estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically purchase residual value insurance on our financing leases so that our risk of loss at lease termination will be less than 10% of the initial value of the lease. In addition, we have several channels for re-leasing or marketing those assets. \\nIn connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",

On a periodic basis, operating lease assets are reviewed for impairment and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of operating lease assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. The carrying amount of leased assets is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon the eventual disposition of the equipment.

Substantially all of our leased assets are protected against casualty loss through third-party insurance. \\nAS LESSEE We enter into lease agreements to obtain the right to \\nuse assets for our business operations, substantially all of which are real estate. Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets are recognized when we enter into operating or financing leases and represent our obligations and rights to use these assets over the period of the leases and may be re-measured for certain modifications, resolution of certain contingencies involving variable consideration, or our exercise of options (renewal, extension, or termination) under the lease. \\nOperating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance \\nfixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, adjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered probable of exercise when measured. The lease payments are discounted using a rate determined when the lease is recognized. As we typically do not know the discount rate implicit in the lease, we estimate a discount rate that we believe approximates a collateralized borrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease. The discount rate is updated when re-measurement events occur. The related operating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease liabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. \\nWe present operating lease liabilities in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities and the related operating lease ROU assets in other assets.

Beneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and subordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain beneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to time, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new securitization transaction. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for additional information about our involvement with SPEs. \\nThe assets and liabilities transferred to a SPE are excluded \\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies as a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. \\nFor transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we \\nrecognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained (including beneficial interests or mortgage servicing rights) and all liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest income for the difference between assets obtained (net of liabilities incurred) and the carrying amount of the assets sold. Beneficial interests obtained from, and liabilities incurred in, securitizations with off-balance sheet entities may include debt and equity securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and liabilities, other assets, and other obligations such as liabilities for mortgage repurchase losses or long-term debt and are accounted for as described within this Note. \\nMortgage Servicing Rights \\nWe recognize MSRs resulting from a sale or securitization of loans that we originate (asset transfers) or through a direct purchase of such rights. We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. Commercial MSRs are subsequently measured at LOCOM. The valuation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities). \\nFor MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are \\nreported in mortgage banking noninterest income in the period in which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at LOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is reported in mortgage banking noninterest income, analyzed monthly and adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment rates, as well as other factors. \\nMSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated \\nfor impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we stratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by individual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. \\nWells Fargo & Company 103', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",

We use the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the estimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for leasehold improvements. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill is recorded for business combinations when the purchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net assets, including identifiable intangible assets. \\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level \\non an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. We have determined that our reporting units are at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We identify the reporting units based on how the segments and reporting units are managed, taking into consideration the economic characteristics, nature of the products and services, and customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a significant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion of goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested business. \\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \\nof goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge to other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited. \\nWe amortize customer relationship intangible assets on an \\naccelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset. Impairment is permanently recognized by writing down the asset to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities \\nDERIVATIVES  We recognize all derivatives on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet at fair value. On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we categorize the derivative as either an accounting hedge, economic hedge or part of our customer accommodation trading and other portfolio. \\nAccounting hedges are either fair value or cash flow hedges. \\nFair value hedges represent the hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, including hedges of foreign currency exposure. Cash flow hedges represent the hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received related to a recognized asset or liability. \\nEconomic hedges and customer accommodation trading and', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 123}),\n",

Economic hedges are derivatives we use to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks associated with our non-trading activities. Customer accommodation trading and other derivatives primarily represents derivatives related to our trading business activities. We report changes in the fair values of these derivatives in noninterest income. \\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a portion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the amortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes in fair value related to the hedged risk with the offset recorded in earnings. We present derivative gains or losses in the same income statement category as the hedged asset or liability, as follows: • For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amounts are reflected in net interest income; \\n• For hedges of foreign currency risk, amounts representing the fair value changes less the accrual for periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in noninterest income. The periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest income; \\n• For hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, amounts representing the fair value change less the accrual for periodic cash flow settlements is attributed to both net interest income and noninterest income. The periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest income. \\nThe entire derivative gain or loss is included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge \\nrelationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency denominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities hedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of these swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net interest income and the difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings is recorded in OCI. \\nCASH FLOW HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses from these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same income statement category as the hedged item. For cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with floating-rate commercial loans and long-term debt and for cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk associated with fixed-rate long-term debt, these amounts are reflected in net interest income. The entire gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. \\nDOCUMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT FOR \\nACCOUNTING HEDGES For fair value and cash flow hedges \\nqualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at \\ninception the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our evaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions.

We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item using the regression analysis method. \\nDISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge \\naccounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue the designation of a derivative as a hedge, or (4) in a cash flow hedge, a derivative is de-designated because it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur. \\nWhen we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no \\nlonger adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. The remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, these amounts are amortized into net interest income over the remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the accumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately reclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in noninterest income. \\nWhen we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is \\nprobable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is reclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued and it is probable the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported in OCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to noninterest income.

       " Document(page_content='EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  We may purchase or originate financial \\ninstruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception of the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate it from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative at fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at fair value with changes recorded in noninterest income and reported within our consolidated balance sheet as a derivative asset or liability. The accounting for the remaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities of a similar type and reported within our consolidated balance sheet based upon the accounting classification of the instrument. \\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING  By using derivatives, \\nwe are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the applicable requirements, including determining the legal enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments (CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives. \\nCash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate \\nderivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to separate non-derivative receivables or payables.

The full yield curve approach aligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected benefit payment cash flows. This change does not affect the measurement of our pension obligation as the change in interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain (loss). We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate to our pension expense. Previously, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate. We made this change to improve the correlation between the yield curve and the projected benefit payment cash flows. \\nOur determination of the reasonableness of our expected \\nlong-term rate of return on plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected returns under two sets of conditions: (1) projected returns using several forward-looking capital market assumptions, and (2) historical returns for the main asset classes, which allows us to capture multiple economic cycles. We place greater emphasis on the forward-looking return and risk assumptions than on historical results. We use the resulting projections to derive a baseline expected rate of return and risk level for the Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \\npublished by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our specific experience. \\nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \\nliabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting actuarial gain or loss in OCI.

See Note 21 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) for additional information on our pension accounting. \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize.\\xa0An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement.\\xa0Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not.

Our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan provides awards for employee services in the form of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share rights (RSRs), performance share awards (PSAs) and stock awards without restrictions. Stock options have not been issued in the last three years and no stock options were outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nStock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant \\ndate.

For these awards, the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in our stock price. Awards granted in 2021 no longer included these discretionary conditions and are not adjusted for subsequent changes in stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also fluctuates based on the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions.\\xa0The total expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized upon the completion of the performance period (the determination of which awards will vest is a combination of performance conditions and discretion). \\nEarnings Per Common Share \\nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. \\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \\nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \\nare required to record them at fair value, when we have elected the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to fair value only as required through the application of an accounting method such as LOCOM, the measurement alternative, or write-downs of individual assets. We classify our assets and liabilities measured at fair value \\nbased upon a three-level hierarchy that assigns the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels are as follows: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. \\n• Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions that are not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of discounted cash flow models, market comparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar techniques. \\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to \\nassess the appropriate classification of financial instruments \\nwithin the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in availability of observable market data, which also may result in changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. \\nSee Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for a more \\ndetailed discussion of the valuation methodologies that we apply to our assets and liabilities. \\nWells Fargo & Company 107', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

We determine the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated by NRSROs at December\\xa031, 2021, and December\\xa031, 2020. \\nTable 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

We generally require a fee to extend such commitments. Certain commitments are subject to loan agreements with covenants regarding the financial performance of the customer or borrowing base formulas on an ongoing basis that must be met before we are required to fund the commitment. We may reduce or cancel consumer commitments, including home equity lines and credit card lines, in accordance with the contracts and applicable law. For unconditionally cancelable commitments at our discretion, we do not recognize an ACL. \\nWe may, as a representative for other lenders, advance \\nfunds or provide for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in less than a week and would normally require default of both the customer and another lender to expose us to loss. The unfunded amount of these temporary advance arrangements totaled approximately $90.2 billion at December\\xa031, 2021. \\nWe issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in \\npurchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At December\\xa031, 2021, and December\\xa031, 2020, we had $1.5\\xa0billion and $1.3\\xa0billion, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial letters of credit. We also originate multipurpose lending commitments under which borrowers have the option to draw on the facility for different purposes in one of several forms, including a standby letter of credit. See Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information on standby letters of credit. \\nWhen we enter into commitments, we are exposed to credit \\nrisk. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because a significant portion of these commitments are not funded. We manage the potential risk in commitments to lend by limiting the total amount of commitments, both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these commitments and by applying the same credit standards for these commitments as for all of our credit activities. For loans and commitments to lend, we generally require \\ncollateral or a guarantee. We may require various types of collateral, including commercial and consumer real estate, autos, other short-term liquid assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Collateral requirements for each loan or commitment may vary based on the loan product and our assessment of a customer’s credit risk according to the specific credit underwriting, including credit terms and structure. \\nThe contractual amount of our unfunded credit \\ncommitments, including unissued standby and commercial letters of credit, is summarized by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable in Table 4.4.

Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if modified in a TDR. The revolving loans converted to term loans in the credit card loan category represent credit card loans with modified terms that require payment over a specific term. \\nPayment deferral activities instituted in response to the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of delinquencies for customers who otherwise would have moved into past due status. \\nWells Fargo & Company 121', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 140}),\n",

Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending on whether the property address resides in a judicial or non-judicial state. Judicial states require the foreclosure to be processed through the state’s courts while non-judicial states are processed without court intervention.

We do not consider loan resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related modifications are generally not classified as TDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement. For additional information on the TDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report. \\nWe may require some consumer borrowers experiencing \\nfinancial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned permanent modification, to determine if they can perform according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans transferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which may include: • underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently making markets in those securities; \\n• providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \\n• entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \\n• holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \\n• acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n• providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \\n• providing seller financing to VIEs. \\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity \\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan sale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell originated and purchased residential \\nand commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitizations pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant to the VIE. \\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

At December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, our liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was $173\\xa0million and $221\\xa0million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $13.3 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. \\nOff-balance sheet mortgage loans sold or securitized \\npresented in Table 8.3 are predominantly loans securitized by the GSEs and GNMA. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees. Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers as sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer and the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. \\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell whole loans to \\nVIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs. \\nTable 8.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe period for which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds and recorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these interests are initially measured at fair value.

Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table 13.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this required disclosure is not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more representative of our exposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \\nNon-investment grade represents those guarantees on', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 166}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Non-investment grade represents those guarantees on \\nwhich we have a higher risk of performance under the terms of the guarantee. If the underlying assets under the guarantee are non-investment grade (that is, an external rating that is below investment grade or an internal credit default grade that is equivalent to a below investment grade external rating), we consider the risk of performance to be high. Internal credit default grades are determined based upon the same credit policies that we use to evaluate the risk of payment or performance when making loans and other extensions of credit. Credit quality indicators we usually consider in evaluating risk of payments or performance are described in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses). STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, \\nwhich include performance and financial guarantees, for customers in connection with contracts between our customers and third parties. We also originate multipurpose lending commitments under which borrowers have the option to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including as a standby letter of credit. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending commitments where we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a customer if the customer fails to meet their contractual obligations. Total maximum exposure to loss includes the portion of multipurpose lending facilities for which we have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. \\nDIRECT PAY LETTERS OF CREDIT  We issue direct pay letters of \\ncredit to serve as credit enhancements for certain bond issuances.

       " Document(page_content='Note 13:  Guarantees and Other Commitments (continued) \\nWRITTEN OPTIONS  We enter into certain derivative contracts \\nthat have the characteristics of a guarantee. These contracts \\ninclude written put options that give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price by a specified date. They also include certain written options that require us to make a payment for increases in fair value of assets held by the counterparty. These written option contracts generally permit or require net settlement. While these derivative transactions expose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options written to customers with cash securities or other offsetting derivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. See Note 16 (Derivatives) for additional information regarding written derivative contracts. \\nLOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE  In certain sales and \\nsecuritizations of loans, including mortgage loans, we provide recourse to the buyer whereby we are required to indemnify the buyer for any loss on the loan up to par value plus accrued interest. We provide recourse, predominantly to GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. Substantially all of these programs and arrangements require that we share in the loans’ credit exposure for their remaining life by providing recourse to the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata basis in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs and arrangements, if certain events occur within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss reported in Table 13.1 represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral. We also provide representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these guarantees is separately considered and provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and warranties. \\nEXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES  We are members \\nof several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we use to clear our trades and those of our customers. It is common that all members in these organizations are required to collectively guarantee the performance of other members and of the organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these organizations. Some membership rules require members to assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another member’s default or from non-member default losses after applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 13.1 because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote.

We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that could occur for non-performance by our customers on transactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions subject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations related to the settlement of margin accounts and short positions, such as written call options and securities borrowing transactions. \\nWe enter into other types of indemnification agreements in \\nthe ordinary course of business under which we agree to indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us. These relationships or transactions include those arising from service as a director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements relating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various other business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to determine our potential future liability under these agreements. We do, however, record a liability for residential mortgage loans that we expect to repurchase pursuant to various representations and warranties. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the cardholder. If we are unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in connection with our merchant processing services because most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring cash or other collateral. In 2021, we processed card network transaction \\nvolume of $1.7 trillion as a merchant acquiring bank, and related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were immaterial. \\nWells Fargo & Company 148', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n",

These obligations are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \\nThe Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the \\npayment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion at December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that subsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the Parent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. For additional information regarding other restrictions on the Parent’s ability to receive dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries, see Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions).

Our securities financing activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.

Plaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees where available under federal and state law.

The consent orders require remediation to customers and the payment of a total of $1.0 billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their behalf. Multiple putative class actions alleging, among other things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI policies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into one multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district litigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class action against the Company and its executive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to two alleged misstatements. In addition, the Company is subject to a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that customers are entitled to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender. In November 2021, the court granted final approval of an agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay $45\\xa0million and make certain changes to its GAP refund practices in order to settle the action. Allegations related to the CPI and GAP programs were among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which has been dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues related to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer auto loans, including related insurance products. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state attorneys general. \\nCOMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION In October and \\nNovember 2020, plaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud class actions, which were consolidated into one lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former officers made false and misleading statements or omissions regarding, among other things, the Company’s commercial lending underwriting practices, the credit quality of its commercial credit portfolios, and the value of its commercial loans, collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. \\nCOMPANY 401(K) PLAN REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS Federal \\ngovernment agencies, including the United States Department of Labor, are reviewing certain transactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. \\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION  Wells Fargo', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 172}),\n",

Visa, MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages, as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July\\xa013, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately $6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants.\\xa0Other merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On June\\xa030, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings. On November\\xa023,\\xa02016, prior class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3\\xa0billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately $94.5\\xa0million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants.

Plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys’ fees that were included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. In March 2020, the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company paid $18.5 million to resolve the claims of the initial certified class in the Hernandez \\ncase, which was approved by the district court in October 2020. The Hernandez  settlement was subsequently reopened to include \\nadditional borrowers who the Company determined should have been included in the settlement class because the Company identified a population of additional borrowers during the relevant class period whose loans had not previously been reviewed for inclusion in the original population of impacted customers. In June 2021, the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay an additional approximately $22 million to resolve the Hernandez  case, which \\nwas approved by the district court in January 2022. In July\\xa02021, the Company entered into an agreement in the Ryder  case \\npursuant to which the Company will pay $12 million to cover other impacted borrowers who were not included in the Hernandez  case, which was approved by the district court in \\nJanuary 2022. The Dore, Coordes, and Liguori cases have been \\nvoluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding these and other mortgage servicing matters. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business and insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order. In addition, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. \\nWells Fargo & Company 154', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION  In August \\n2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura) \\nand Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells\\xa0Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of their representation and warranty breaches. \\nOFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION  The Company has self-identified \\nan issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells\\xa0Fargo software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related financing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is cooperating with an inquiry from the United States Department of Justice (Department of Justice). \\nRETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS Federal and state government \\nagencies, including the Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. On February\\xa021, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of Justice’s criminal investigation into the Company’s retail sales practices, as well as a separate agreement to resolve the Department of Justice’s civil investigation. As part of the Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will be filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all the terms of the agreement. The Department of Justice criminal settlement also includes the Company’s agreement that the facts set forth in the settlement document constitute sufficient facts for the finding of criminal violations of statutes regarding bank records and personal information. On February\\xa021, 2020, the Company also entered into an order to resolve the SEC’s investigation arising out of the Company’s retail sales practices. The SEC order contains a finding, to which the Company consented, that the facts set forth include violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. As part of the resolution of the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, the Company made payments totaling $3.0 billion. The Company has also entered into agreements to resolve other government agency investigations, including investigations by the state attorneys general. In addition, a number of lawsuits were filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into various settlements to resolve these lawsuits.

       " Document(page_content='Limited and certain related entities and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) filed complaints in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging claims against the Company in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. The Company previously settled two class actions with similar allegations that were filed in November 2014 and December 2016 by institutional investors in the Southern District of New York and New York state court, respectively. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed complaints that were consolidated in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation. In March 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve the case filed by the NCUA. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION  The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells\\xa0Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. In December 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds that the Tribe is a necessary party and that the individual beneficiaries lack standing to bring claims. The motion was denied in June 2018. The case is pending trial. \\nOUTLOOK  As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible potential losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $2.9 billion as of December\\xa031, 2021. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 155', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Note 16: Derivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading or other purposes. \\nRisk Management Derivatives \\nOur asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and earnings. In a fair value or economic hedge, the effect of change in fair value will generally be offset by the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income. Customer Accommodation Trading \\nWe also use various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, as an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve engaging in market-making activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security transactions. These customer accommodations and any offsetting derivatives are treated as customer accommodation trading and other derivatives in our disclosures. Additionally, embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contracts are included in the customer accommodation trading and other derivatives disclosures, as applicable. \\nWe mention derivative instruments within several other \\nNotes in this Report.

See Note 25 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans, and paid on certain floating-rate debt due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate.

The types of derivatives used include swaps, swaptions, constant maturity mortgages, forwards, Eurodollar and Treasury futures and options contracts. Loan commitments for mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered derivatives. Residential MSRs, derivative loan commitments, certain residential mortgage LHFS, and our economic hedge derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in mortgage banking noninterest income. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information on this economic hedging activity and mortgage banking income. Customer Accommodation Trading and Other For customer accommodation trading purposes, we use swaps, futures, forwards, spots and options to assist our customers in managing their own risks, including interest rate, commodity, equity, foreign exchange, and credit contracts. These derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter into derivatives for risk management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading and other derivatives also \\ninclude embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contract. We periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and CDs where the performance of the hybrid instrument note is linked to an equity, commodity or currency index, or basket of such indices. These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the note in a manner similar to a derivative instrument and therefore are considered to contain an “embedded” derivative instrument. The indices on which the performance of the hybrid instrument is calculated are not clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The “embedded” derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative. Additionally, we may invest in hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives, such as credit derivatives, that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract. In such instances, we either elect fair value option for the hybrid instrument or separate the embedded derivative from the host contract and account for the host contract and derivative separately. \\nWells Fargo & Company 161', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 180}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Credit Derivatives \\nCredit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is \\nderived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to another party (the seller of credit protection). We use credit derivatives to assist customers with their risk management objectives predominantly by purchasing and selling credit protection on corporate debt obligations through the use of credit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help manage counterparty exposure. We would be required to perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest payment. \\nTable 16.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives. \\nTable 16.7: Sold Credit Derivatives \\nNotional amount \\n(in millions) Protection sold Protection sold – \\nnon-investment \\ngrade \\nDecember 31, 2021 \\nCredit default swaps \\nRisk participation swaps \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 8,033 6,756 \\n14,789 1,982 6,012 \\n7,994 \\nDecember 31, 2020 (1) \\nCredit default swaps Risk participation swaps \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 5,707 6,378 \\n12,085 1,805 6,262 \\n8,067 \\n(1) Prior period balances have been conformed to current period presentation. \\nProtection sold represents the estimated maximum \\nexposure to loss that would be incurred, if upon an event of \\ndefault, the value of our interests and any associated collateral declined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of recovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from collateral held or any economic hedges. \\nThe amounts under non-investment grade represent the \\nnotional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets \\nunder the credit derivative have an external rating that is investment grade. If an external rating was not available, we classified the credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit derivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order to achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk management is designed to provide an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold credit derivatives. \\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features \\nCertain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand additional collateral or require termination or replacement of derivative instruments in a net liability position.

       " Document(page_content='Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities \\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments \\nto certain assets and liabilities and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 17.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 17.4 in this Note. We provide in Table 17.8 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities carried at amortized cost. \\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed description of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \\nAssets \\nTRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded \\nat fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using internal trader prices that are subject to price verification procedures, which includes comparing against multiple independent pricing sources, including prices obtained from third-party pricing services. These services compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine if observable market information is being used versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an internal trader price, compared with pricing service prices, considerations include the range and quality of pricing service prices in addition to observable trade data. Pricing service prices are used to ensure the reasonableness of a trader price; however, valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. If a trader asserts that a third-party pricing service price is not reflective of fair value, justification for using the trader price, including recent sales activity where possible, must be provided to and approved by the appropriate levels of management. Substantially all of our trading debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. \\nAVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. \\nWhen vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \\nadjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal models use discounted cash flow techniques or market comparable pricing techniques. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS generally includes \\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. A majority of residential LHFS and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading business is based on pending transactions when available. Where market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \\nLOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that are based on the observable market price of the loan or current appraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs)  Residential MSRs are \\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are carried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that estimates the present value of expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of prepayment rates (including housing price volatility for residential MSRs), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. \\nWells Fargo & Company 164', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='DERIVATIVES  Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis. The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives, which \\ninclude certain equity option contracts, are primarily measured using available quoted market prices. The fair value of non-exchange-traded derivatives, which predominantly relate to derivatives traded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, are measured using internal valuation techniques, as quoted market prices are not always readily available. Valuation techniques and inputs to internal models depend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is based. Key inputs can include yield curves, credit curves, foreign exchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements and correlation of certain of these inputs. \\nEQUITY SECURITIES  Marketable equity securities and certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account for at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for using the equity method, cost method or measurement alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar securities of the same issuer. \\nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value for such securities. We use all available information in making this determination, which includes observable transaction prices for the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, we make adjustments\\xa0to observed market data to reflect the comparative differences between the market data and the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public companies and other investment-specific considerations like liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the instruments. \\nOTHER ASSETS Although other assets are generally recorded at \\namortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease ROU assets and foreclosed assets. Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a discounted cash flow model. \\nLiabilities \\nSHORT-SALE TRADING LIABILITIES  Short-sale trading liabilities in \\nour trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, where available. When quoted prices for the same instruments are not available or markets are not active, fair values are estimated using recent trades of similar securities. \\nLevel 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes \\nWe generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices obtained from vendors.

Some of the inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to historical experience and other third-party data where available. \\nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our \\nmodel risk management policies and procedures, which include model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, processing components, logic or theory, output results and supporting model documentation. Validation also includes ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate given observable market transactions or other market data within the same or similar asset classes. \\nWe also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our \\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models continue to perform as expected, include: • ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions and other independent market data (including pricing vendors, if available); \\n• back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized transactions; and \\n• review of modeled valuation results against expectations, including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in value. \\nWe update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \\nreflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing \\nmodels are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model revalidations as necessary. \\nInternal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by \\nthe appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function \\nand monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. \\nIndependent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, \\nprovides independent oversight of model risk management, and its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk Committee. \\nVENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS  We routinely obtain pricing \\nfrom third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In certain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities that we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve and periodically review third-party vendors to ensure information obtained and valuation techniques used are appropriate. This review may consist of, among other things, obtaining and evaluating control reports issued and pricing methodology materials distributed.

       " Document(page_content='The internal valuation techniques used for our Level 3 assets \\nand liabilities, as presented in Table 17.3, are described as \\nfollows:\\xa0• Discounted cash flow – Discounted cash flow valuation \\ntechniques generally consist of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of an instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. \\n• Market comparable pricing – Market comparable pricing valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of certain instruments by incorporating known inputs, such as recent transaction prices, pending transactions, financial metrics of comparable companies, or prices of other similar investments that require significant adjustment to reflect differences in instrument characteristics. \\n• Option model – Option model valuation techniques are generally used for instruments in which the holder has a contingent right or obligation based on the occurrence of a future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going above or below a predetermined strike price. Option models estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. \\nThe unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \\nthose we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset \\nor liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation. Following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table.\\xa0• Comparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to observed market data, such as a transaction price to reflect dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or other factors used within a market valuation approach, expressed as a percentage of an observed price. \\n• Conversion Factor – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a particular instrument may be exchanged for another instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage change from a specified rate. \\n• Correlation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument changing in price relative to another based on an established relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. \\n• Cost to service – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing such loan portfolios. \\n• Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a constant default rate (CDR). \\n• Discount rate – is a rate of return used to calculate the present value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at the fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium component. The benchmark rate component, for example, OIS, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or U.S. Treasury rates, is generally observable within the market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. The risk premium component reflects the amount of compensation market participants require due to the uncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting from risks such as credit and liquidity. \\n• Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio that are likely of not funding.', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 188}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio that are likely of not funding. \\n• Initial-value servicing – is the estimated value of the underlying loan, including the value attributable to the embedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of outstanding unpaid principal balance. \\n• Loss severity – is the estimated percentage of contractual cash flows lost in the event of a default. \\n• Multiples – are financial ratios of comparable public companies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value of equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value, adjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial, or marketability to the comparable public company used in a market valuation approach. \\n• Prepayment rate – is the estimated rate at which forecasted prepayments of principal of the related loan or debt instrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant prepayment rate (CPR). \\n• Volatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is estimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. \\n• Weighted average life – is the weighted average number of years an investment is expected to remain outstanding based on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated date the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the instrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing of an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not contractually fixed. \\nInterrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \\nUsage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 17.3 requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. \\nCertain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a \\ndirectionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change in another input having a potentially muted impact to the overall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a change in one unobservable input may result in a change to another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify the fair value impact. \\nDEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE\\xa0 The internal models \\nused to determine fair value for these Level 3 instruments use certain significant unobservable inputs within a discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing valuation technique. Such inputs include discount rate, prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, multiples, and comparability adjustment. \\nThese Level 3 assets would decrease (increase) in value \\nbased upon an increase (decrease) in discount rate, default rate or loss severity inputs and would generally decrease (increase) in \\nWells Fargo & Company 169', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 188}),\n",

The comparability adjustment input may have a positive or negative impact on fair value depending on the change in fair value of the item the comparability adjustment references. \\nGenerally, a change in the assumption used for the default \\nrate is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the risk premium component of the discount rate (specifically, the portion related to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable inputs for comparability adjustment, multiples, and loss severity do not increase or decrease based on movements in the other significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 assets. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS  The discounted cash flow models \\nused to determine fair value of Level 3 MSRs utilize certain significant unobservable inputs including prepayment rate, discount rate and costs to service. An increase in any of these unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the MSRs and alternatively, a decrease in any one of these inputs would result in the MSRs increasing in value. Generally, a decrease in discount rates increases the value of MSRs, unless accompanied by a related update to our prepayment rates. The cost to service assumption generally does not increase or decrease based on movements in the discount rate or the prepayment rate. The sensitivity of our residential MSRs is discussed further in Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities). \\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  Level 3 derivative instruments are \\nvalued using market comparable pricing, option pricing and discounted cash flow valuation techniques which use certain unobservable inputs to determine fair value. Such inputs consist of prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, initial-value servicing, fall-out factor, volatility factor, weighted average life, conversion factor, and correlation factor. \\nLevel 3 derivative assets (liabilities) where we are long the \\nunderlying would decrease (increase) in value upon an increase (decrease) in default rate, fall-out factor, conversion factor, or loss severity inputs. Conversely, Level 3 derivative assets (liabilities) would generally increase (decrease) in value upon an \\nTable 17.4: Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis increase (decrease) in prepayment rate, initial-value servicing, weighted average life or volatility factor inputs. The inverse of the above relationships would occur for instruments when we are short the underlying. The correlation factor input may have a positive or negative impact on the fair value of derivative instruments depending on the change in fair value of the item the correlation factor references. \\nGenerally, for derivative instruments for which we are \\nsubject to changes in the value of the underlying referenced instrument, a change in the assumption used for default rate is accompanied by directionally similar change in the risk premium component of the discount rate (specifically, the portion related to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates.

       " Document(page_content='Note 17:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) \\nWe typically use a market approach to estimate the fair \\nvalue of our nonmarketable private equity and venture capital \\ninvestments in portfolio companies. The market approach bases the fair value measurement on market data (for example, use of market comparable pricing techniques) that are used to derive the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Market comparable pricing techniques may include utilization of multiples and recent or anticipated transactions (for example, a financing round, merger, acquisition or bankruptcy) involving the subject portfolio company, or participants in its industry or related industries. Based upon these recent or anticipated transactions, current market conditions and other factors specific to the issuer, we make adjustments to estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As a result of the recent market environment, we also utilized other valuation techniques. These techniques included the use of company risk factors in the estimation of the fair value of certain nonmarketable equity securities. The company risk factors are based upon entity-specific considerations including the debt and liquidity profile, projected cash flow or funding issues as well as other factors that may affect the company’s outlook. \\nFair Value Option \\nThe fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or liabilities, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the fair value option to align the measurement model with how the financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity \\nTable 17.7: Fair Value Option or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion of the portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS measured at fair value include \\nresidential mortgage loan originations for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist to reliably support our valuations. Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, and related\\xa0direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. We believe fair value measurement for LHFS reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. \\nAdditionally we purchase loans for market-making purposes \\nto support the buying and selling demands of our customers in our trading business. These loans are generally held for a short period of time and managed within parameters of internally approved market risk limits. Fair value measurement best aligns with our risk management practices. Fair value for these loans is generally determined using readily available market data based on recent transaction prices for similar loans. \\nTable 17.7 reflects differences between the fair value \\ncarrying amount of the assets for which we have elected the fair value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal amount at maturity. Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing included in LHFS for which we have elected the fair value option were insignificant at December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020. \\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 \\n(in millions) Fair value \\ncarrying \\namount Aggregate\\nunpaid \\nprincipal Fair value \\ncarrying \\namount\\xa0less \\naggregate\\nunpaid \\nprincipal Fair value \\ncarrying \\namount Aggregate \\nunpaid\\nprincipal Fair value \\ncarrying\\namount\\xa0less \\naggregate\\nunpaid\\nprincipal \\nLoans held for sale $ 15,895 15,750 145 18,806 18,217 589 \\nThe changes in fair value related to initial measurement and', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 191}),\n",

Dividends on the common stock shares allocated as a result of the release and conversion of the ESOP preferred stock reduce retained earnings, and the shares are considered outstanding for computing earnings per share.

In determining the end of year benefit obligation, we assumed an average annual increase of approximately 7.50% for health care costs in 2022. This rate is \\nassumed to trend down 0.30%-0.40% per year until the trend \\nrate reaches an ultimate rate of 4.50% in 2030. The 2021 periodic benefit cost was determined using an initial annual trend rate of 7.80%. This rate was assumed to decrease 0.30%-0.40% per year until the trend rate reached an ultimate rate of 4.50% in 2030. \\nInvestment Strategy and Asset Allocation \\nWe seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a prudent level of risk, given the benefit obligations of the pension plans and their funded status. Our overall investment strategy is designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a moderate amount of long-term growth opportunities while ensuring that risk is mitigated through diversification across numerous asset classes and various investment strategies, coupled with an investment strategy for the fixed income assets that is generally designed to approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the Cash Balance Plan’s benefit obligations. The Cash Balance Plan currently has a target asset allocation mix comprised of the following ranges: 75%-85% fixed income, 10%-20% equities, and 0%-10% in real estate, private equity and other investments. The Employee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes several members of senior management, formally reviews the investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/ liability evaluations are also conducted. Other benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h) \\ntrust, which are invested with a target mix of 50%-60% equities and 40%- 50% fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree \\nMedical Plan Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust, which are predominantly invested in fixed income securities and cash. Members of the EBRC formally review the investment risk and performance of these assets on a quarterly basis. \\nProjected Benefit Payments \\nFuture benefits that we expect to pay under the pension and other benefit plans are presented in Table 21.7. \\nTable 21.7: Projected Benefit Payments \\nPension benefits \\nNon- Other', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 201}),\n",

This group of assets also includes highly liquid government securities such as U.S. Treasuries, limited partnerships valued at the NAV and collective investment funds described above. \\nDomestic, Global, International and Emerging Market Stocks  – \\ninvestments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at quoted market values. This group of assets also includes investments in registered investment companies and collective investment funds described above. \\nReal Estate  – includes investments in real estate, which are \\nvalued at fair value based on an income capitalization valuation approach. Market values are estimates, and the actual market price of the real estate can only be determined by negotiation between independent third parties in sales transactions. This group of assets also includes investments in exchange-traded equity securities and collective investment funds described above. \\nHedge Funds / Absolute Return  – includes investments in \\nregistered investment companies, collective investment funds, and limited partnerships, as described above. \\nOther  – insurance contracts that are stated at cash surrender \\nvalue. This group of assets also includes investments in registered investment companies and collective investment funds described above. \\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value \\ncalculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Eligible employees are 100% vested in their base and discretionary contributions after three years of service. A three-year service vesting requirement for matching contributions applies to employees hired after December 31, 2020. Base and matching contributions are made annually at year-end, and the discretionary contribution, if awarded, is made no later than the due date for the Company’s federal income tax return (including extensions) for the plan year.

See Note 25 (Other Comprehensive Income) for additional information. \\nWe have determined that a valuation allowance is required \\nfor 2021 in the amount of $267 million, attributable to deferred tax assets in various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized due to lack of sources of taxable income, limitations on carry back of losses or credits and the inability to implement tax planning to realize these deferred tax assets. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized based on our history of earnings, sources of taxable income in carry back periods, and our ability to implement tax planning strategies. \\nAt December\\xa031, 2021, we had net operating loss and tax \\ncredit carry forwards with related deferred tax assets of $382\\xa0million. If these carry forwards are not utilized, they will mostly expire in varying amounts through December\\xa031, 2041. We do not intend to distribute earnings of certain non-U.S. \\nsubsidiaries in a taxable manner, and therefore intend to limit distributions to non-U.S. earnings previously taxed in the U.S., that would qualify for the 100% dividends received deduction, and that would not result in any significant state or non-U.S. taxes. All other undistributed non-U.S. earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and the related tax liability on these earnings is insignificant. \\nTable 23.4 presents the change in unrecognized tax benefits. \\nTable 23.4: Change in Unrecognized Tax Benefits \\nYear ended\\xa0\\nDecember 31,\\xa0\\n(in millions) \\nBalance at beginning of year \\nAdditions: $ 2021 \\n4,826 2020 \\n6,996 \\nFor tax positions related to the current year For tax positions related to prior years \\nReductions: 441 259 52 \\n263', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 206}),\n",

The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments. \\nIn February 2021, we announced an agreement to sell \\nWells\\xa0Fargo Asset Management (WFAM), and in first quarter 2021, we moved the business from the Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to Corporate.

The capital ratio requirements for the Bank included a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.

The FRB conducts an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and has also published guidance regarding its supervisory expectations for capital planning, including capital policies regarding the process relating to common stock dividend and repurchase decisions in the FRB’s SR Letter 15-18.

These covered transactions may not exceed 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus (which for this purpose represents tier 1 and tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital rules, plus the balance of the ACL excluded from tier 2 capital) with any single nonbank affiliate and 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus with all its nonbank affiliates. Covered transactions that are extensions of credit may require collateral to be pledged to provide added security to the bank. \\nAdditionally, federal laws and regulations limit the \\ndividends that a national bank may pay. Dividends that may be paid by a national bank without the express approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are generally limited to that bank’s retained net income for the preceding two calendar years plus net income up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net income, as defined by the OCC, consists of net income less dividends declared during the period. Our national bank subsidiaries could have declared additional dividends of $5.1\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2021, without obtaining prior regulatory approval. We have elected to retain higher capital at our national bank subsidiaries to meet internal capital policy minimums and regulatory requirements. Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal \\nand state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year.

Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nCritical Audit Matters \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk \\ncharacteristics utilizing multiple credit loss models. The Company estimated the ACL for commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived through historical observation of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which forecast expected credit losses in the portfolio based on historical experience of delinquency and default rates and loss severity. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to measure expected credit losses. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to its historical loss rates, evaluated through historical observations of default and losses after default. A portion of the ACL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. \\nWells Fargo & Company 197', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 216}),\n",

The Company recognizes MSRs when it retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. \\nWe identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including \\nspecialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs.

       "  Document(page_content='First is creating a platform-based, API-driven architecture that enables similar banking \\nservices to be used across diferent products. Instead of building large applications as we have in the past, this API-driven architecture relies on a nimble set of smaller applications that provide common features and customer data across products and services. It’s a “once built, many times consumed” approach. This won’t happen all at once, but we have a clear path ahead. Over time, our presence will evolve to this model, improving customer experience and allowing us to get new products and services to market more quickly. \\nAs a foundation to this, our Digital Infrastructure Strategy, which we announced in 2021, \\narticulates our approach to moving toward cloud-enabled applications, initially using both public and private cloud solutions and also migrating to a set of modern data centers that will host our private cloud platforms. \\nSecond is a technology-frst approach to our businesses. This is a material change \\nfrom our approach today. We compete with fntech companies where engineers who understand products also design solutions for customers. Wells Fargo, like many other banks, often develops a solution and then asks engineers to build it. We are moving toward an agile approach to development to bring our teams much closer and speed up timelines to get to market. \\nAll of this is good progress, but it’s not enough. As I’ve said before, we need to move from \\nan approach where technology aids our business to where technology drives our business. This is a tough journey, but without it, we signifcantly reduce our chances of success. \\nESG and company reputation \\nWe believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders – in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. Our history has shown this to be true. Consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation. A strong reputation is achieved not just from strong fnancial performance, but from actively supporting employees, customers, and communities – especially those most in need. \\nWe have supported our employees consistently through the pandemic, which I wrote \\nabout at some length in my letter to you last year. In November 2021, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefts and competitive pay to our employees, we would provide supplemental pay from October 2021 to the end of January 2022 to eligible branch employees in active status, in recognition of their contributions during the pandemic. We also announced an increase in U.S. minimum hourly pay levels to a range of $18-22, based on role, location, and market conditions. Over a five-year time period, from 2017-2021, we increased average wages for U.S. hourly employees by nearly 25%. Over the same time period, we increased our investment in U.S. employee benefts by over 20%. \\nX \\n2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 11})]}"

       " 'source_documents': [Document(page_content='First is creating a platform-based, API-driven architecture that enables similar banking \\nservices to be used across diferent products. Instead of building large applications as we have in the past, this API-driven architecture relies on a nimble set of smaller applications that provide common features and customer data across products and services. It’s a “once built, many times consumed” approach. This won’t happen all at once, but we have a clear path ahead. Over time, our presence will evolve to this model, improving customer experience and allowing us to get new products and services to market more quickly. \\nAs a foundation to this, our Digital Infrastructure Strategy, which we announced in 2021, \\narticulates our approach to moving toward cloud-enabled applications, initially using both public and private cloud solutions and also migrating to a set of modern data centers that will host our private cloud platforms. \\nSecond is a technology-frst approach to our businesses. This is a material change \\nfrom our approach today. We compete with fntech companies where engineers who understand products also design solutions for customers. Wells Fargo, like many other banks, often develops a solution and then asks engineers to build it. We are moving toward an agile approach to development to bring our teams much closer and speed up timelines to get to market. \\nAll of this is good progress, but it’s not enough. As I’ve said before, we need to move from \\nan approach where technology aids our business to where technology drives our business. This is a tough journey, but without it, we signifcantly reduce our chances of success. \\nESG and company reputation \\nWe believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders – in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. Our history has shown this to be true. Consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation. A strong reputation is achieved not just from strong fnancial performance, but from actively supporting employees, customers, and communities – especially those most in need. \\nWe have supported our employees consistently through the pandemic, which I wrote \\nabout at some length in my letter to you last year. In November 2021, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefts and competitive pay to our employees, we would provide supplemental pay from October 2021 to the end of January 2022 to eligible branch employees in active status, in recognition of their contributions during the pandemic. We also announced an increase in U.S. minimum hourly pay levels to a range of $18-22, based on role, location, and market conditions. Over a five-year time period, from 2017-2021, we increased average wages for U.S. hourly employees by nearly 25%. Over the same time period, we increased our investment in U.S. employee benefts by over 20%. \\nX \\n2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Developments” section in this Report. \\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and \\nestimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future, and our financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting.\\xa0 Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are \\nrequired to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For a description of these policies, see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. \\nCertain of our financial instruments, including derivative \\nassets and liabilities, debt securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment, and there is no assurance that our models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant inputs required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings. \\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires \\nour management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. In addition, our customers may rely on the effectiveness of our internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be “independent” of us under SEC rules, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences. \\n*\\xa0 *\\xa0 * \\nWells Fargo & Company 85', metadata={'source': '/home/chandan/orange/code/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",

Since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019, 11 of 16 Operating Committee members are new to the company. Additionally, well over half of the senior most people at our company, meaning those who are one level below the Operating Committee, are new to their roles, and a signifcant proportion of them were hired from outside the company. This is a dramatic change in our leadership and to the group of people responsible for driving the cultural and process changes required for our transformation. We have recruited highly qualifed people with experience in their areas of expertise and have promoted talented leaders within Wells Fargo. \\nWe’ve also signifcantly changed how we run the company. We have regular detailed \\nbusiness reviews, we prioritize resources across the entire company, and we ensure that we diferentiate the performance of our people, rewarding strong performers and coaching those who need to improve. We expect people to prioritize what’s right for our customers, we value execution, and we embrace direct conversations that push us to improve. We celebrate our success but focus on what we can do to improve. \\nFinancial and strategic progress \\nAfter a strategic review in 2020 that resulted in the sale or reductions of several of our businesses, we are making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We are just now beginning to bring to market diferentiated products and services. The number of signifcant opportunities ahead is exciting, but we are only at the beginning of building the culture necessary to transform how we compete in today’s world. \\nI can’t say it enough – job one has been and will continue to be building and implementing \\nan appropriate risk and control infrastructure across the company, embedding changes in our culture, and doing the work with urgency. But we are also investing in our strategic positioning. \\nThough our market shares remain strong, we have been slow in improving and \\nexpanding our capabilities to compete with the best banks and non-banks across all of our businesses. This is changing. All of our lines of business have signifcant opportunities to meaningfully grow, and we are investing in long-term plans to move our franchise forward. There is more competition than ever before, but I continue to feel great about our competitive position and energized about the opportunities in front of us.  \\nConsumer digital \\nAn example is our consumer mobile platform. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced a rebuilt mobile banking experience for Consumer & Small Business customers, and we began rolling it out in the frst quarter of 2022. It has a new, modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs.
