The Company has \\nestablished management committees, including those focused \\non risk, that support management in carrying out its governance and risk management responsibilities.

The Enterprise Risk & Control \\nCommittee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management program. \\nThe ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its \\nmembership is comprised of principal line of business and certain enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also escalates certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with the Company’s escalation management policy. \\nEach principal line of business and enterprise function has a \\nrisk and control committee, which is a management governance committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its scope limited to the respective principal line of business or enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. \\nAs a complement to these risk and control committees,', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",
