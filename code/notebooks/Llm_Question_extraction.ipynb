What are your insights toward China’s ambition? How will Deutsche Bank help China \\nin reaching its goal?  \\nA: The public commitment of China to reach carbon neutrality in 2060 offers hope to the \\nglobal environment movement. The global climate change targets will start to look much more \\nattainable if China starts to consistently meet its carbon neutrality milestones and targets in \\nthe coming years. This can only happen if we can make the pivot towards sustainability \\ncommercially viable.

As a global bank, we see ourselves ideally positioned to address the key \\nchallenge of matching ESG standards in China with globally accepted ESG standards. \\nDeutsche Bank’s ESG framework is aligned closely with the EU ESG Taxonomy, which is \\nwidely considered as a comprehensive set of ESG standards. All ESG transactions at \\nDeutsche Bank are reviewed and classified as ESG-compliant via an internal control function \\n(Group Sustainability) that operates independently of our commercial business units.

Sustainable Finance \\n15. \\nQ: What are the steps Deutsche Bank is taking to avoid green washing? \\nA: We take the issue of “green washing” and “green wishing” very seriously as they the \\ncredibility of our ESG activity needs to be safeguarded. For us, ESG is about transparency \\naround mid- and long-term risk - encompassing both non-financial and financial risks. In order \\nto avoid green washing, first of all, we have policies and guidelines to ensure adherence to the \\nlatest regulations (for example the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) on classifying \\nwhat can be considered as sustainable.  \\nSecond, we have governance in place to ensure we adhere to these policies and guidelines \\nwhich are monitored by Group Sustainability.  \\nLastly, transparency is key. We believe it is important to increase transparency to our clients. \\nFor this, in addition to adhering to the latest disclosure requirements, we are investing in our \\ndata and systems to increase reporting and transparency to our stake holders, but also \\nbuilding our own capacity (for example through training) to make the data and information \\nmore understandable to our clients. \\n \\n16. \\nQ: Would you share with us your best advice to help us communicate ESG initiatives to clients \\nin Emerging Markets? \\nA: Our suggestions for this is first, shift clients’ focus to the mid to long-term, covering both \\nfinancial and non-financial risks and factors (such as the quality of company's management). \\nWe have observed that the more an enterprise abstains from short-term gains at the expense \\nof the environment, or the social context it operates in, the more sustainable its revenues are \\nlikely to be in the long-term. Furthermore, we are seeing more local governments for example \\nin China and Singapore developing policies and regulations in ESG (for example on carbon \\npeak and carbon neutrality in China, water sustainability in Singapore).

The essence of \\nmy question is: ‘how is the spirit of sacrifice applied to discussions with clients?’ \\nA: Rather than clients finding ESG financing more expensive than traditional financing, we are \\nincreasingly seeing a funding benefit to clients, as strong growth in ESG Asset under \\nManagement (AuM) worldwide supports pricing of ESG issuances. Additionally, ESG-KPI \\nlinked deals are sometimes structured so clients get a funding benefit during the lifetime of \\nthe transaction when they meet their ESG-KPI targets. This is something we support, as such \\na benefit in funding costs helps offset other costs they might have incurred, for example \\ncapital expenditures in reaching their ESG goals. \\n \\n21. \\nQ: What is your view on Impact Investing in third-world countries? \\nA: Our Fixed Income and Currencies (IB FIC) is looking for critical infrastructure project which \\nare in line with a government development plans and in line with any commitments the \\nsovereign has made to international agencies such as the IMF and which positively contribute \\nto the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG). \\nExample deal: Last year we arranged EUR 142m financing for the Ivory Coast to fund the \\nconstruction of two regional hospitals and five new medical units in the country, a critical \\ninfrastructure project for the country.

If not specific for Deutsche Bank, could \\nyou comment on the trends in the industry?

Incentives are also planned to \\nincrease the share of electric cars in its fleet. \\nIn general we cannot comment on any existing or potential client relationships, however we \\nadhere to our existing policies in doing business.  \\nRegarding the oil sector: Deutsche Bank stopped financing new projects in the Arctic region \\nin 2020. In addition, the bank does not finance oil sands exploration, transportation and \\nprocessing. While we do not comment on a potential client, we are committed to reviewing \\nclients in the oil and gas sector with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions and targets \\nthat are aligned with the Paris Agreement. \\nIn addition for project finance we apply strict due diligence requirements. To emphasise our \\ncommitment to a sorrow environmental and social (ES) due diligence we signed up in July \\n2020 to the Equator Principles which is a recognised ES due diligence Framework used by the \\nfinancial industry.  \\nRegarding the coal power sector: we do have strict policies covering financing of coal. Since \\n2016 we do not finance any new coal development be it coal power or coal mining. We do not \\nfinance any development of coal related infrastructure. In 2020 we additionally committed \\nexiting financing of the thermal coal mining by 2025. \\nRegarding controversial weapons: Deutsche Bank via its policy commitment do not tolerate \\nthe use of several weapon systems. Deutsche Bank’s Cluster Munitions Policy was replaced in \\nMay 2019 by the Controversial Weapons Policy. This rules out the direct financing of any \\ncontroversial weapons including cluster munitions but also chemical, biological radioactive \\nand nuclear weapons as well as anti-personnel mines. In case of still existing relationships \\nwith a nexus to controversial weapons we will respect those due to contractual obligations \\nuntil maturity. However, commitments will not be renewed.\", metadata={'source': 'document.pdf', 'file_path': 'document.pdf', 'page': 36, 'total_pages': 45, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': 'Sustainability Deep Dive Q&A – Consolidated chat questions and anwers', 'author': 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'subject': '', 'keywords': 'Public', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2013', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2013', 'creationDate': \"D:20210616124943+02'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20210616130006+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

We place strong focus on building bridges and also \\naddressing challenges of living and working with hidden disabilities.

This includes ensuring a diverse slate of \\ncandidates is considered (UK/US), gender neutral job ads, diverse interview panels, engaging \\nwith suppliers and organizations specializing in gender and racial diversity.

What are your insights toward China’s ambition? How will Deutsche Bank help China \\nin reaching its goal?  \\nA: The public commitment of China to reach carbon neutrality in 2060 offers hope to the \\nglobal environment movement. The global climate change targets will start to look much more \\nattainable if China starts to consistently meet its carbon neutrality milestones and targets in \\nthe coming years. This can only happen if we can make the pivot towards sustainability \\ncommercially viable.

Sustainable Finance \\n15. \\nQ: What are the steps Deutsche Bank is taking to avoid green washing? \\nA: We take the issue of “green washing” and “green wishing” very seriously as they the \\ncredibility of our ESG activity needs to be safeguarded. For us, ESG is about transparency \\naround mid- and long-term risk - encompassing both non-financial and financial risks. In order \\nto avoid green washing, first of all, we have policies and guidelines to ensure adherence to the \\nlatest regulations (for example the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) on classifying \\nwhat can be considered as sustainable.  \\nSecond, we have governance in place to ensure we adhere to these policies and guidelines \\nwhich are monitored by Group Sustainability.  \\nLastly, transparency is key. We believe it is important to increase transparency to our clients. \\nFor this, in addition to adhering to the latest disclosure requirements, we are investing in our \\ndata and systems to increase reporting and transparency to our stake holders, but also \\nbuilding our own capacity (for example through training) to make the data and information \\nmore understandable to our clients. \\n \\n16. \\nQ: Would you share with us your best advice to help us communicate ESG initiatives to clients \\nin Emerging Markets? \\nA: Our suggestions for this is first, shift clients’ focus to the mid to long-term, covering both \\nfinancial and non-financial risks and factors (such as the quality of company's management). \\nWe have observed that the more an enterprise abstains from short-term gains at the expense \\nof the environment, or the social context it operates in, the more sustainable its revenues are \\nlikely to be in the long-term. Furthermore, we are seeing more local governments for example \\nin China and Singapore developing policies and regulations in ESG (for example on carbon \\npeak and carbon neutrality in China, water sustainability in Singapore).

The essence of \\nmy question is: ‘how is the spirit of sacrifice applied to discussions with clients?’ \\nA: Rather than clients finding ESG financing more expensive than traditional financing, we are \\nincreasingly seeing a funding benefit to clients, as strong growth in ESG Asset under \\nManagement (AuM) worldwide supports pricing of ESG issuances. Additionally, ESG-KPI \\nlinked deals are sometimes structured so clients get a funding benefit during the lifetime of \\nthe transaction when they meet their ESG-KPI targets. This is something we support, as such \\na benefit in funding costs helps offset other costs they might have incurred, for example \\ncapital expenditures in reaching their ESG goals. \\n \\n21. \\nQ: What is your view on Impact Investing in third-world countries? \\nA: Our Fixed Income and Currencies (IB FIC) is looking for critical infrastructure project which \\nare in line with a government development plans and in line with any commitments the \\nsovereign has made to international agencies such as the IMF and which positively contribute \\nto the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG). \\nExample deal: Last year we arranged EUR 142m financing for the Ivory Coast to fund the \\nconstruction of two regional hospitals and five new medical units in the country, a critical \\ninfrastructure project for the country.

If not specific for Deutsche Bank, could \\nyou comment on the trends in the industry?

We are following these discussions closely and have already implemented \\nregulations applicable to jurisdictions where we operate – the Sustainable Finance Disclosure \\nRegulation (SFDR) Europe for example. At the same time, we can observe that regulation is \\nstill in flux. Given this context, we help investors to realise real opportunities for ESG \\ninvestment in a number of ways. First and foremost: ESG is about providing transparency on \\nmid to long-term risks – and this includes both non-financial and financial risks. Second, our \\npolicies and guidelines ensure we adhere to the latest regulations on classifying what can be \\nconsidered as sustainable. Third, we have governance in place to ensure we adhere to these \\npolicies and guidelines. Last but not least, transparency is key. We believe it is important to \\nincrease transparency to our clients. Therefore we are investing in our data and systems to \\nincrease transparency and reporting to our clients; we are also enhancing our expertise (for \\nexample through training) so we are able to make the data and information around ESG more \\nunderstandable to our clients. \\n \\n52.  \\nQ: In your presentations,  so far “Themes” have been highlighted with the common symbol for \\n“nuclear energy”.

Our bank is investing in measures to reduce CO2-emissions from its own \\noperations. Unavoidable emissions are offset by purchasing and retiring high-quality emission \\nreduction certificates on a voluntary market.

It set tangible targets for all sustainability \\ndimensions and ensures a consistent dialogue with our people.

While we \\nunderstand the public attention for the number it is mainly a result in staying competitive in \\nmarkets where we compete with global banks on capital markets.  \\nIn answer to the question on Deutsche Bank's car fleet: We just announced the change in our \\ncompany car fleet policy. By 2030, Deutsche Bank aims to reach a carbon zero car fleet in \\nGermany. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank set itself the target to reduce company car fuel \\nconsumption by 30 % by 2025, measured against 2019. Incentives are also planned to \\nincrease the share of electric cars in its fleet. \\nIn general we cannot comment on any existing or potential client relationships, however we \\nadhere to our existing policies in doing business.  \\nRegarding the oil sector: Deutsche Bank stopped financing new projects in the Arctic region \\nin 2020. In addition, the bank does not finance oil sands exploration, transportation and \\nprocessing. While we do not comment on a potential client, we are committed to reviewing \\nclients in the oil and gas sector with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions and targets \\nthat are aligned with the Paris Agreement. \\nIn addition for project finance we apply strict due diligence requirements. To emphasise our \\ncommitment to a sorrow environmental and social (ES) due diligence we signed up in July \\n2020 to the Equator Principles which is a recognised ES due diligence Framework used by the \\nfinancial industry.  \\nRegarding the coal power sector: we do have strict policies covering financing of coal. Since \\n2016 we do not finance any new coal development be it coal power or coal mining. We do not \\nfinance any development of coal related infrastructure. In 2020 we additionally committed \\nexiting financing of the thermal coal mining by 2025. \\nRegarding controversial weapons: Deutsche Bank via its policy commitment do not tolerate \\nthe use of several weapon systems. Deutsche Bank’s Cluster Munitions Policy was replaced in \\nMay 2019 by the Controversial Weapons Policy. This rules out the direct financing of any \\ncontroversial weapons including cluster munitions but also chemical, biological radioactive \\nand nuclear weapons as well as anti-personnel mines. In case of still existing relationships \\nwith a nexus to controversial weapons we will respect those due to contractual obligations \\nuntil maturity. However, commitments will not be renewed. \\n\", metadata={'source': 'document.pdf', 'file_path': 'document.pdf', 'page': 36, 'total_pages': 45, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': 'Sustainability Deep Dive Q&A – Consolidated chat questions and anwers', 'author': 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'subject': '', 'keywords': 'Public', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2013', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2013', 'creationDate': \"D:20210616124943+02'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20210616130006+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

We place strong focus on building bridges and also \\naddressing challenges of living and working with hidden disabilities.

This includes ensuring a diverse slate of \\ncandidates is considered (UK/US), gender neutral job ads, diverse interview panels, engaging \\nwith suppliers and organizations specializing in gender and racial diversity.
