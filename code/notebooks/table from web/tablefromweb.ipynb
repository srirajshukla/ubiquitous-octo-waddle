However, there is a large gap between the level of ambition of the country/area commitments and targeted temperatures. Companies, which are responsible for a vast majority of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emissions, must play a critical role in filling the gap left by country/area commitments by raising the level of ambition in their target setting and reducing their emissions in line with climate science.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Science-based target setting methods enable companies to set emissions targets that are consistent with conserving the remaining global emissions budget. A number of factors are taken into consideration in order to determine what is most appropriate for a given company.

CDP considers targets approved by the initiative to reflect best practices in science-based target setting. Due to the waiting list for target validation, companies are encouraged to book a validation slot and submit their targets to the SBTi as early as possible in order for these targets to be used for scoring in CDP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2023 climate change questionnaire.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Regardless of submission to SBTi, companies are expected to report emissions reductions targets in their CDP response. Targets that did not pass the SBTi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review process or that have not been submitted for review prior to the deadline will still be evaluated using the information disclosed by each company in their CDP response.

Additionally, companies are expected to account for land-based emissions and removals and set FLAG targets to address these emissions. Land-based emissions and removals should be included within the boundary of an SBTi-approved FLAG target when reporting progress against that target.
