0,Underway,"This target is company-wide and covers 95% of both our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with some small exclusion due to poor data availability from some of our smaller sites and leased spaces in Southeast Asia. We have not included any land-related emissions within the target boundary.",By the reporting year we have achieved most of our target. To achieve further reductions we plan to keep improving our operational and logistics efficiency alongside electrification of our domestic vehicle fleet to achieve deep cuts to emissions. Alongside this we will continue to increase our sourcing of zero-carbon electricity. The progress curve is likely to be variable.,
1,Underway,"This company-wide target covers 70% of all our Scope 3 emissions, focusing on the largest categories most relevant to our business activities (Employee commuting, Business travel) while exclusing several minor categories which we aim to reduce through separate measures.","We are changing our procurement processes to include environmental criteria and therefore incentivize the purchase of lower-emissions products, reducing emissions. We are also pursuing remote working opportunities where possible for our administrative staff. We are also minimizing business travel where possible. Our biggest measure in this category is to encourage and support our employees to switch to low-carbon modes of transport. We have implemented a program which helps employees purchase season tickets for public transport and are trialing leasing electric vehicles for some employees.",
