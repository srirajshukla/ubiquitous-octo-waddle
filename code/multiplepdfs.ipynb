The ERCC receives information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management program. \\nThe ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its \\nmembership is comprised of principal line of business and certain enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also escalates certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with the Company’s escalation management policy. \\nEach principal line of business and enterprise function has a \\nrisk and control committee, which is a management governance committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its scope limited to the respective principal line of business or enterprise function.

For example, the \\ndecision to include in our targets both the financing we provide clients \\nthrough lending activities and the \\nfinancing we facilitate through debt \\nand equity capital markets activities \\ncontinues to apply to all currently \\ncovered sectors. Likewise, our decision \\nto use committed exposure (credit \\navailable to a client) rather than \\noutstanding exposure (funds drawn \\nfrom that available credit by a client) \\nin attributing client emissions to \\nour financing activities applies to all \\ncurrently covered sectors. (See \\nSection 2.2 of CO2eMission  for a \\ndetailed description of our universal \\ndesign choices.) Other design choices \\nare made on a sector-specific basis, \\nsuch as what activities and emissions \\nscopes the targets will cover and \\nwhich metric and climate scenario \\nto use to establish a target.\\nThough setting targets for five \\nsectors is helpful, we are mindful \\nof the challenges and limitations \\nof bank target setting for financed \\nemissions.

Despite the discrepancy \\nwith the scenario, we focused our \\ntarget on the emissions intensity \\nassociated with manufacturers’ new \\nvehicle sales only. By limiting our target \\nto new vehicle sales, we can focus \\nattention and financing activities as \\nmanufacturers evolve their production \\nand sales to reflect the anticipated \\ngrowth in the electric vehicle market \\nand avoid penalizing them for existing \\nvehicle stock for which vehicle \\nretirement is beyond their control.\\nThe IEA NZE 2050 scenario assumes \\na rapid shift from internal combustion \\nengine vehicles to electric vehicles. \\nUnder the scenario, a majority of total \\npassenger car and light-duty truck \\nsales globally are electric vehicles \\nby 2030 and almost all sales in those \\nsame categories are electric vehicles \\nby 2050. To align with the IEA NZE \\n2050 pathway, we set a 2030 target \\nfor passenger cars and light-duty \\ntrucks of 103 g CO2e/vkm, a 53% \\nreduction from a 2021 baseline of 220 g \\nCO2e/vkm.

Our Board is grateful to management and each of our \\nemployees who continue to push forward with our transformation and create value for our shareholders. \\nAs we continue to focus on value creation, it remains critical that our Board is comprised of the right mix of directors with varied backgrounds and experiences. Our current Board is the result of continuous and intentional Board refreshment over the last several years, including the addition of three new directors at our last annual shareholder meeting. At the same time, since Charlie Scharf joined the Company in 2019, he has built and led a leadership team that we believe brings the skills necessary to continue developing a customer-centric culture while effectively managing risk. Our Board believes that the Company’s senior management team is well-equipped to successfully execute our strategy and make continued progress on our transformation. \\nIn 2022, Wells Fargo continued its focus on building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a company of our size and scale, \\nand this continues to be the Company’s top priority. We feel confident in the progress that management has made, and yet we believe that there is still much work to be done. The Board will continue its focus on overseeing this critical body of work. Our Board carries out its risk oversight responsibilities directly and through specific Board committees and discusses significant risk and regulatory matters with management at each of our regularly scheduled Board meetings. \\nIn addition to progressing on regulatory priorities, over the last year Wells Fargo also continued investing in its future. The Company has made progress in simplifying the business, advancing its digital and technological capabilities to meet the evolving needs of customers, and executing on its efficiency initiatives. As a Board, we know that progress in these areas helps position the Company for the future and enhances shareholder value. \\nOur Board, along with the CEO and the Operating Committee, will continue to set the tone from the top regarding our expectations for the highest standards of integrity, excellence, and sound risk management as we continue to focus on building Wells Fargo for the future. \\nTo our shareholders, thank you for your trust and continued investment in Wells Fargo. \\nSincerely, \\nSteven D.

In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about our expectations for our operations and business and our corporate responsibility progress, plans, and goals (including environmental and human capital matters). Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy, and other future conditions. The inclusion of such statements is not an indication that these contents are necessarily material to investors or required to be disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any historical practice of doing so, except as may be required by law. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

Our approach to variable compensation, the framework and goals that the Human Resources Committee (“HRC”) considered in its decision process, and our executive compensation policies and practices are \\nunchanged from last year. The design of our 2023 executive compensation program remains the same, except that the HRC increased the absolute return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) requirement to earn awards at or above target. \\nCompensation Actions \\n2022 CEO Compensation Highlights: \\n•\\t Increased our CEO’s target total compensation to $27 million to better align with our peers, while allowing for year-to-year variability in actual CEO pay as determined by the performance-based nature of the program. \\n•\\t Exercised negative discretion to keep total compensation flat to last year for the CEO, at $24.5 million, and below what otherwise would have been earned, given the strength of our financial and non-financial performance and the CEO’s individual performance in 2022. \\nThe Board (for the CEO) and HRC’s approach and decision criteria to determine total compensation for our CEO, and other named executive officers (“NEOs”), are detailed in the \\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis  section of this proxy statement. \\nOther Highlights \\nThe Board and management engaged with our shareholders throughout the year, which provided shareholders the opportunity to provide direct feedback. In response to shareholder feedback, we enhanced our disclosure in three key areas: (1) CEO and NEO base salary levels; (2) peer group selection; and (3) HRC’s approach to compensation decisions. \\nOur executive compensation program is designed to align with our business, performance, risk, and talent needs and reinforce our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy.

Our Board has set the number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting at 13. Our Board believes that the nominees bring the right mix of professional experiences, capabilities, and diverse perspectives to provide effective oversight and governance of our Company’s strategy and risk management – especially as relates to our top priority to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure – and management’s execution of its responsibilities. All nominees are currently directors of the Company and were elected by our shareholders at the 2022 annual shareholder meeting. \\nOur Board has adopted a retirement age policy pursuant to which individuals will not be nominated for election for a term that would begin after the individual’s 72\\nnd birthday. \\nHowever, the Board may approve the nomination of such individual if, due to special or unique circumstances, the Board determines that it is in the best interests of our Company and shareholders for the individual to be nominated for election. Nominee Richard B. Payne, Jr. will be 75 at the time of nomination for re-election to the Board. In light of Mr. Payne’s skills and experience, and based on the recommendation of the Governance & Nominating Committee (“GNC”), the Board determined to nominate Mr. Payne for election to the Board at the 2023 annual shareholder meeting. In determining to do so, the Board considered, among other things, the relatively short tenure of Mr. Payne and the short average tenure of all directors, as well as Mr. Payne’s contributions to the Board. In particular, the Board found that Mr. Payne – with his approximately 40 years of corporate and commercial banking experience at financial institutions: \\n•\\t exhibits extensive knowledge of the risk and regulatory environment for institutions like ours, including knowledge that qualifies him as a risk expert under the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards for U.S. bank holding companies; \\n•\\t demonstrates valuable expertise in risk management and credit in connection with his service on the Risk Committee; \\n•\\t provides astute leadership in his role as the Chair of the Credit Subcommittee; and \\n•\\t contributes to the Board by serving as a strong independent steward of the interests of shareholders. \\nThe Board is also focused on director independence, which is important for the Board to effectively review and challenge management, and on Board refreshment and continuity during a time of transformation. \\nOur Board has determined that each nominee for election as a director at the annual meeting is an independent director, except for Charles W. Scharf, as discussed under the \\nDirector Independence  section of this proxy statement. Directors are elected to hold office \\nuntil our next annual shareholder meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. All nominees have told us that they are willing to serve as directors. If any nominee is no longer a candidate for director at the annual shareholder meeting, the proxy holders will vote for the rest of the nominees and may vote for a substitute nominee designated by the Board, or our Board may reduce its size. In addition, as described under the \\n Director \\nElection Standard and Nomination Process  section of this proxy statement, each director \\nnominee has tendered his or her resignation as a director in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines to be effective only if he or she fails to receive the required vote for election to our Board and our Board accepts the resignation.

       " Document(page_content='Corporate Governance \\nDirector Independence \\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a significant majority of the directors on our Board, and all members of the Audit \\nCommittee, GNC, HRC, and Risk Committee, must be independent under applicable independence standards. Each year, our Board affirmatively determines the independence of each director and each nominee for election as a director. Under New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules, in order for a director to be considered independent, our Board must determine that the director has no material relationship with our Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company). To assist our Board in making its independence determinations, our Board adopted the Director Independence Standards appended to our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These Director Independence Standards consist of the NYSE’s “bright line” standards of independence, as well as additional standards, known as categorical standards of independence, adopted by our Board. The Director Independence Standards are available on our website at: \\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/ \\ncorporate/governance . \\nBased on the Director Independence Standards, our Board considered information in early 2023 regarding banking and financial services, commercial, charitable, familial, and other relationships between each director and director nominee, his or her respective immediate family members, and/or certain entities affiliated with such directors, director nominees, and immediate family members, on the one hand, and our Company, on the other, to determine the director’s or director nominee’s independence. After reviewing the information presented to it and considering the recommendation of the GNC, our Board determined that, except for Charles W. Scharf, who is a Wells Fargo employee, all other current directors and director nominees are independent under the Director Independence Standards: Steven D. Black, Mark A. Chancy, Celeste A.

The Chairs of our Board and certain of its Committees, as well as the Chair of our WFBNA Board, meet individually with our bank regulators. \\n•\\t From time to time, directors are also offered the opportunity to learn more about specific risk and regulatory matters by way of informal sessions with relevant executives and are empowered to seek access to management and independent advisors to obtain any additional information needed. Our Independent Board Chair has extensive risk management experience. He engages with our regulators, shareholders, and other stakeholders, including on key risk and regulatory matters; seeks to incorporate risk and regulatory topics in regular discussions between the Board and management; and provides input on the composition of the Board and its committees so that each has the diversity of skills and experiences necessary to oversee our risks. \\nFor more information about our risk management framework, see the “Risk Management” discussion in the 2022 Form 10-K. \\nRole of the Board \\nOur Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing the Company’s risk management. The Board’s role in this regard is to assess management’s performance, provide credible challenge, hold senior management accountable for maintaining an effective risk management program and adhering to risk management expectations, and provide an effective reporting system to the Board. Specifically, the Board’s risk-related oversight responsibilities include reviewing, monitoring and where appropriate, approving: \\n•\\t Our strategic plan, risk appetite, risk management framework, and financial performance. \\n•\\t Our significant policies, programs, and plans, including whether they are consistent with our strategic plan, risk appetite, and risk management. \\n•\\t Accountability of senior management for implementing the Company’s strategic plan, including risk appetite, and maintaining the Company’s risk management and control framework. \\n•\\t Board composition, governance structure, and practices that support the Company’s risk profile, risk appetite, and strategic plan, including having directors with diverse skills, knowledge, experience, and perspectives. \\n•\\t Our independent risk management (including compliance), legal, and internal audit functions. \\n•\\t Our culture of ethics, compliance, and risk management, and the processes adopted by senior management for maintaining the integrity and reputation of the Company. \\nWhen reviewing risks, the Board evaluates the materiality and control effectiveness of risks and may modify the frequency or manner of its oversight to match the impacts of risks facing the Company. \\nThe Company periodically engages third-party advisors and experts to assist in the development and maintenance of its risk management programs, policies, and practices.

The following table shows our cash compensation program prior to April 1, 2022, and on or after April 1, 2022. Cash retainers and fees are paid quarterly in arrears. Any non-employee director who joins the Board during the year receives a prorated annual cash retainer. \\nAnnual Cash Component  Amount Prior to \\nApril 1, 2022  ($)  Amount on or After \\nApril 1, 2022  ($)  \\nCash Retainer\\t  75,000  \\n \\n \\n  \\n 100,000 \\nIndependent Chair Retainer  1\\t  250,000 250,000 \\nCommittee/Subcommittee Chair Fees \\nEach of Audit and Risk Committees  40,000 50,000 \\nHRC  25,000 50,000 \\nEach of CRC, Finance Committee, and GNC  25,000 25,000 \\nEach of Credit and Technology Subcommittees  — 10,000 \\nRegular or Special Board or Committee/Subcommittee Meeting Fee2  2,000 per meeting 03    \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Corporate Governance \\n(1)\\t The Board’s independent Chair receives a $250,000 annual retainer in lieu of any Committee Chair fee the independent Chair might otherwise receive. Effective \\nJanuary 1, 2023, we began paying the independent Chair annual retainer entirely in Company common stock and requiring deferral of that retainer until the Chair leaves the Board, or later, if elected. \\n(2)\\t Includes standing Committee/subcommittee meetings, as well as special purpose committee meetings not held concurrently with or immediately prior to or following a Company Board or Committee/subcommittee meeting. \\n(3)\\t $2,000 per meeting in excess of 12 meetings. \\nDirectors of WFBNA received an additional $10,000 annual cash retainer. Effective April 1, 2022, the chair of the WFBNA Board also \\nbegan receiving an annual fee of $25,000, payable quarterly in arrears. The RCOC chair also received a total chair fee of $13,750 (the chair’s annual fee decreased effective April 1, 2022, from $25,000 to $10,000). \\n2022 Equity Compensation \\nFor 2022, each non-employee director elected to our Board at our Company’s annual meeting of shareholders received on that date an award of Company common stock having a value of $240,000. The dollar value of each stock award was converted to a number of shares of Company common stock using the closing price on the grant date, rounded up to the nearest whole share. Effective January 1, 2023, we began paying the annual equity award in the form of RSRs and requiring deferral of all such RSRs until a director leaves the Board, or later, at the election of the director. \\nDeferral Program \\nFor 2022, non-employee directors were able to defer all or part of their cash compensation and equity awards. Cash compensation could be deferred into either an interest-bearing account or common stock units with dividends reinvested. The interest rate paid in 2022 on interest-bearing accounts was 1.45%. Equity awards could be deferred only into common stock units with dividends reinvested. Deferred amounts are paid either in a lump sum or installments, as elected by the director. \\nStock Ownership Policy \\nEach non-employee director, within five years after joining our Board, must hold shares of our common stock having a value equal to five times the annual cash retainer and maintain at least that ownership level while a member of our Board and for one year after service as a director ends. Holding deferred shares counts towards a non-employee director’s ownership level, regardless of whether the award(s) underlying the deferred shares have vested. Each director who has been on our Board for five years or more exceeded this ownership level as of December 31, 2022, and each director who has served less than five years is on track to meet this ownership level.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

Our Board has adopted robust stock ownership policies that apply to our directors and executive officers as summarized in the chart below. \\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK OWNERSHIP POLICY  \\nREQUIREMENTS \\nWhile employed by the Company and for one year following \\nretirement, our executive officers must hold shares of Wells Fargo common stock equal to at least 75% of the after-tax profit shares (assuming a 50% tax rate) acquired upon the exercise of stock options or upon the distribution of other stock-based awards if the total value of Wells Fargo common stock the executive owns is less than three times cash salary (six times cash salary for the CEO) (the minimum threshold amount), and at least 50% of such after-tax profit shares if the total value of Wells Fargo common stock the executive owns is greater than the applicable minimum threshold amount. DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP POLICY  \\nREQUIREMENTS \\nAfter five years on the Board, each non-employee director \\nmust own stock having a value equal to five times their annual cash retainer, and maintain at least that stock ownership level while a member of the Board and for one year after service as a director terminates. \\nShares counted toward ownership include deferred shares a non-employee director holds in the Directors Stock Compensation and Deferral Plan (Directors Plan), shares (or share equivalents) an executive officer holds in the Company 401(k) Plan, Supplemental 401(k) Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan, Direct Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, and shares owned by an executive officer’s spouse. Executives also may include the value of 50% of the target number of Wells Fargo common shares subject to his or her unvested full-value stock-based awards. Compliance with these stock ownership requirements is calculated annually and reported to the GNC (for non-employee directors) or to the HRC (for executive officers). \\nAnti-Hedging Policies \\nTo further strengthen the alignment between stock ownership and your interests as shareholders, our Code of Conduct requirements prohibit all employees, including our executive officers and directors, from engaging in derivative or hedging transactions involving any Company securities, including our common stock. This hedging prohibition with respect to Company securities applies to any type of transaction in securities that limits investment risk with the use of derivatives, such as options, puts, calls, futures contracts, or other similar instruments. \\nNo Pledging Policy \\nOur Board has adopted policies which are reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines that prohibit our directors and executive officers from pledging Company equity securities as collateral for margin or other similar loan transactions. \\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

Our culture is guided by a customer-centric focus informed by employee engagement and feedback and reinforced by clear employee expectations. Our employee expectations are designed to be clear and straightforward, to drive the highest standards of integrity and operational excellence, and to provide guidance for doing what’s right and doing it well. \\nRisk-Focused Culture Our Board is responsible for holding senior management accountable for defining and maintaining a culture designed to effectively manage risk. One of our Company’s top priorities is implementing and enhancing an appropriate risk and control framework across our Company. We expect our employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to our customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because we believe risk management is everyone’s responsibility, our employees are empowered and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns. Employees are also required to complete annual risk training. \\nOur performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. Our Board, through the HRC, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to our performance management and incentive compensation programs, and effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations.

Throughout the year, employees are invited to share their thoughts through surveys, town halls, and other means. Employees also submit ideas through our employee feedback platform called Loudspeaker, and some of these ideas have been implemented in recent years, leading to efficiencies, innovation, and greater employee engagement. We conduct various surveys throughout the year, including our quarterly Pulse surveys and annual Global Employee Survey. The surveys are a way for employees to share their candid thoughts and feedback. Senior leadership and our directors analyze employee feedback, as shared in the survey results, to help the Company improve workplace engagement and the way we do business. \\nCustomer Focus We believe that meeting the increasingly diverse needs of our global customer base is critical to our Company’s long-term growth and success. We invest in employee learning and development and believe that when our employees are properly supported, engaged, and confident in their skills, they are more effective leaders and can provide a better customer experience.

       " Document(page_content='Executive Compensation \\nIntroduction \\n \\nExecutive Summary \\nOur executive compensation program is designed to incentivize our NEOs to deliver long-term shareholder value with sound risk \\nmanagement discipline. Our compensation principles and philosophy are designed to incentivize and hold our NEOs accountable for sustaining strong financial and non-financial results that are important to our stakeholders. The majority of the total compensation provided to the CEO and other NEOs is at risk, and delivered primarily in the form of long-term equity, including performance share awards (PSAs) and restricted share rights (RSRs) that are subject to ongoing risk and service conditions, and for PSAs, achieving pre-determined three-year financial performance goals. \\nDuring 2021, the HRC made significant enhancements to our executive compensation program  through active engagement with \\nshareholders. These enhancements became effective for and reflected in the design and disclosure of our 2021 executive compensation program and remained in place for 2022. Specifically:  \\nWhat We Heard from Shareholders How We Responded Enhanced DisclosureGoals: Preference for more disclosure about the goals used to evaluate individual performance \\n ✓ Enhanced description of the goals used to evaluate \\nindividual NEO performance \\nPerformance Assessment: Preference for more disclosure about the factors the HRC considers in assessing performance ✓ Provided additional detail on the performance \\nassessment process used by the HRC \\nVariable Incentive Process: Preference for more disclosure about the process to \\ndetermine variable compensation ✓ Enhanced the disclosure around the HRC’s process for \\ndetermining variable compensation, including \\napplication of performance achievement levels Structural Changes Pay Mix: Preference for a higher proportion of performance-based \\nlong-term equity in CEO pay mix ✓ Increased the weight of PSAs in the CEO’s equity mix to \\n65% with the remaining 35% in RSRs (previously, split \\n50% / 50%) \\nRelative Performance Link: Preference for inclusion of a relative measure in our PSA \\ndesign ✓ Reintroduced relative Return on Tangible Common \\nEquity (“ROTCE”) performance in our PSA design, weighted at 25% (previously 100% absolute ROTCE) \\nPerformance Criteria: Focus on setting rigorous performance criteria ✓ Increased the target performance goal required for \\nthree-year average absolute ROTCE performance to \\nachieve target payout or above \\n* Further increased the three-year average absolute \\nROTCE performance required to achieve target payout or above from 10.5% to 12.0%, for PSAs granted in 2023, for performance year 2022 \\nTotal Shareholder Return (“TSR”): Preference for increased rigor of the TSR structure ✓ Re-evaluated the structure and rigor of TSR in the PSA \\nprogram; payouts adjusted upward by 20% if our TSR is at or above the 75th percentile and reduced by 20% if our TSR is below the 25th percentile (no upward adjustment if absolute TSR is negative) \\nThe enhancements implemented in 2021 were positively received by shareholders, and our Say on Pay vote increased from 57% approval in 2021 to 73% approval in 2022. In 2022, we continued to actively engage with shareholders on our executive \\ncompensation program, as well as other matters. Shareholders broadly reaffirmed their support for the design of our executive compensation program, including the changes implemented in the prior year. For 2022, based on shareholder feedback and following a thorough review of our executive compensation program and peer practices, the HRC determined not to make significant structural changes to our executive compensation program. The HRC also determined that it was important to continue to enhance disclosure of our executive compensation program. For 2022, the HRC made compensation determinations for the CEO and other NEOs that reinforce the alignment of executive pay with performance and long-term shareholder interests.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 63}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Executive Compensation \\nGiven the feedback received during the 2022 shareholder engagement sessions, we provide further details regarding three key \\nquestions raised by shareholders, as discussed under 2022 Say on Pay Vote and Shareholder Engagement . Please also refer to \\nadditional details in later sections of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”). \\n2022 Performance Highlights \\nDuring 2022, the Company delivered strong underlying performance despite the challenging macro environment. While our financial performance was meaningfully impacted by operating losses, our underlying financial performance was strong and reflected the progress we are making to improve returns. Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth, credit losses continued to increase slowly, but credit quality remained strong, and we continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. \\nWe also continued to invest in our strategic capabilities, developing innovative products and solutions to better serve our customers. These included rolling out our new consumer mobile app, relaunching Intuitive Investor\\n®, introducing two new credit \\ncards, and launching a new digital banking platform for our commercial clients. We made changes in 2022 that helped millions of  \\ncustomers avoid overdraft fees. We have also continued to invest in strengthening our risk and control infrastructure. \\nA significant portion of the operating losses incurred in 2022 reflected a December settlement we reached with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which resolved multiple historical issues, many of which have been outstanding for several years. Over the past three years, we have made significant changes to address the matters referenced in the settlement, and many of the required actions were already substantially complete. This settlement followed the termination or expiration of several consent orders since 2020 as the Company continues to focus on strengthening its risk and control infrastructure and delivering on its regulatory commitments. In addition to the operating losses described above, we also experienced changes in the allowance for credit losses, excluding net charge-offs, from 2021 to 2022, as well as the impact from divestitures in 2021. \\nTo better assess the underlying financial performance of the Company and compare year-over-year results, the HRC concluded that it was important to review financial performance on an as-reported and adjusted basis to take into account the impact of the \\nnotable items described below. Please refer to \\n2022 Company Performance  for more details about the Company’s financial \\nperformance and how it was considered in the HRC’s 2022 compensation decisions for the NEOs. \\nThe financial performance metrics featured in the charts below summarize select 2022 and 2021 financial results, which along with \\nour non-financial results, were among the key inputs considered in the HRC’s performance assessment. In addition, the HRC believed it was useful to consider adjustments for notable items that occurred during 2022 and 2021 to better assess the Company’s underlying financial performance for 2022, including as compared with 2021. The financial performance metrics featured in the tables below have been adjusted for the following notable items. \\n2022 Notable Items \\n•\\t Operating losses: litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters related to a variety of historical matters of $2.0 billion (pre-tax) and $3.3 billion (pre-tax) in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively \\n•\\t Change in allowance for credit losses: decrease of $75 million, excluding the impact of net charge-offs \\n2021 Notable Items \\n•\\t Change in allowance for credit losses: decrease of $5.7 billion, excluding the impact of net charge-offs', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n",

The \\nincreases for Mr. Scharf, Mr. Weiss, and Mr. Powell were primarily driven by an increase in the market pay levels for comparable roles.

Instead, for all NEOs other than the CEO, 70% of variable compensation is delivered as long-term equity with half delivered in PSAs and half in RSRs. The remaining 30% of variable compensation is delivered as cash bonus. The HRC also established a pay mix for the CEO, requiring a minimum of 75% of variable compensation to be delivered as long-term equity and the balance as cash bonus. The CEO’s long-term equity is also structured as PSAs and RSRs, representing an equity mix of 65% and 35%, respectively. \\nThroughout 2022, the HRC periodically assessed the Company’s performance against pre-established goals. During the fourth quarter of 2022 and January 2023, the HRC completed in-depth reviews of all aspects of the Company’s financial and non-financial performance, and individual NEO performance. \\nIn January 2023, the Board and the HRC approved the following 2022 compensation outcomes after assessing performance for our \\nCEO and other NEOs, respectively.

While this level of shareholder support represents a significant increase from the previous year, it is still below our desired levels. Following the annual meeting, we continued the efforts of active engagement with shareholders. Our Board Chair and HRC Chair, Corporate Secretary, and leaders from Human Resources, Investor Relations, and ESG teams conducted multiple meetings with shareholders, seeking their feedback on the enhancements and progress we already made and their suggestions on how we could continue to make progress. Our shareholder engagement is summarized below. \\nOffered Meetings\\t \\n54% of our \\noutstanding \\ncommon stock Engaged in Discussions \\n49% of our \\noutstanding \\ncommon stock Director-Led Discussions \\n24% of our \\noutstanding \\ncommon stock \\nThe full Board receives periodic updates from the HRC on shareholder feedback received during shareholder engagement, including input related to our executive compensation program. \\nIn addition to gathering general feedback in 2022, we engaged with shareholders on specific topics pertaining to our executive compensation program. During these discussions, shareholders generally expressed support for the changes discussed in our 2022 CD&A. Shareholders also asked for more information on certain aspects of our executive compensation program: base salary levels for the CEO and the other NEOs, peer group selection and their application to the HRC’s planning and oversight processes, and the HRC’s approach to compensation decision-making. The HRC’s perspective on each of these topics is discussed below. \\nNEO Base Salary Levels \\n•\\t Following the 2008 financial crisis, Wells Fargo raised executives’ base salary levels to provide a more balanced fixed and variable compensation mix. This action was implemented to address concerns regarding the potential for incentive compensation arrangements to lead to excessive risk-taking within financial institutions. The Company maintains this practice given our efforts to promote effective risk management. \\n•\\t Base salaries are an important pay element. For NEOs, the HRC believes that base salary should represent a smaller percentage of total compensation. A majority of the executive compensation should be delivered through variable compensation that is tied to achieving short-term and long-term performance objectives. \\n•\\t The CEO and other NEOs continue to have significant levels of compensation at risk. As mentioned previously, the majority of target total compensation is delivered through variable compensation, at least 75% of which, for the CEO, and 70% for the other NEOs, consists of long-term equity awards, providing strong alignment with shareholder interests. \\n•\\t Our pay for performance philosophy focuses on total target compensation in relation to our Labor Market Peer Group . Historically, \\nthe cash bonus targets were expressed as a percentage of base salary and long-term incentive targets were expressed in dollars. The HRC changed that design in 2022, eliminating the relationship between salary levels and cash bonus targets. Instead, the HRC implemented a consistent variable compensation pay mix for the CEO and all other NEOs. The HRC sets the quantum of NEOs’ target total compensation based on roles and responsibilities and taking into account Labor Market Peer Group compensation policies and practices. The level of base salary does not result in a higher level of total compensation. \\nWells Fargo & Company 58', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Executive Compensation \\nPeer Group Selection \\n•\\t Given the size, scale, and mix of our businesses, and the need to attract and retain the most qualified leadership team, selecting \\nthe appropriate peer groups is a critical decision point for the HRC in order to properly assess our performance and compensation levels. \\n•\\t In 2020, the HRC, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, determined that two separate peer groups provide a better balance, given that our primary talent competitors (Labor Market Peer Group) do not fully align with the types of organizations with which we compete for capital and customers, or best compare to how we are organized and the regulations under which we operate (Financial Performance Peer Group). Our \\nFinancial Performance Peer Group  includes only Global \\nSystemically Important Banks, ensuring that the relative performance standards the HRC uses to evaluate our performance reflect banks that operate with the most similar set of regulatory requirements, providing the best comparison set when considering financial performance. \\n•\\t The HRC continues to rely on two separate peer groups, given their representative alignment with talent and compensation needs, on the one hand, and business and performance, on the other. The HRC will continue to assess the appropriateness of our peer groups in relation to its executive compensation oversight and planning processes. \\nHRC’s Approach to Compensation Decisions \\n•\\t The HRC believes that relying on a single formula to evaluate performance and determine compensation decisions is not practical and will fail to fully consider risk, regulatory, and other non-financial outcomes that are critical to our success. In determining this approach to compensation decisions, the HRC considered the following important factors: \\n•\\t We operate in a dynamic business environment where business and performance needs change quickly, requiring flexibility to re-align our executive compensation program to support our talent and performance needs. \\n•\\t Our performance needs are diverse, reflecting the need to balance management’s accountability for meeting our annual \\n commitments to shareholders and other stakeholders with making progress towards the attainment of our multi-year \\n transformation goals. \\n \\n•\\t Risk is multi-layered and complex, requiring high levels of informed judgement to accurately assess performance and make variable compensation decisions that are balanced, reasonable, and appropriate. \\n•\\t Our executive compensation program incentivizes our NEOs to deliver against performance goals that are derived from our strategic pillars, the first of which is our Risk and Control Culture. Our top priority remains building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure, which is fundamental and critical to our future. \\n•\\t This rigorous process enables the HRC to evaluate Company, CEO, and each of our other NEO’s overall performance, including financial and non-financial results. It informs the HRC’s compensation decisions, ensuring they are balanced, reasonable, and appropriate. The performance goals the HRC sets in the beginning of the year include quantitative measures and qualitative goals. The HRC reviews performance against these goals during and at the end of the year. This allows the HRC to make a holistic performance assessment which then informs the compensation decision. For the CEO and each of the other NEOs, the HRC determines target total compensation (including pay mixes) in the beginning of the year, and also pre-determines the weighting of Company, individual, and, as applicable, line of business performance. \\n2023 Proxy Statement 59', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

Promote Effective Risk \\nManagement \\nCompensation promotes effective risk \\nmanagement and discourages \\nimprudent or excessive risk-taking. Attract and Retain Talent \\nPeople are one of the Company’s \\ncompetitive advantages; therefore, \\ncompensation helps attract, motivate, \\nand retain people with the skills, talent, \\nand experience to drive superior long-term Company performance. \\nThe HRC oversees the design and administration of our executive compensation program, which includes a rigorous and iterative \\nassessment process that takes place throughout the year. The HRC relies on the three executive compensation principles outlined \\nabove that guide its pay for performance philosophy, and the underlying Executive Compensation Framework  described below. The \\nHRC also carefully considers input from its independent advisor, Meridian, and the feedback received from our shareholders. \\nOur Compensation Philosophy \\nOur compensation philosophy reflects and reinforces our executive compensation principles.

The HRC assesses peer pay levels each year in connection with its annual review of NEO compensation. \\nNEO Target Total Compensation \\nEach year the HRC reviews and approves the CEO’s target total compensation, which includes base salary and target variable compensation, as part of its oversight of our executive compensation program. The actual variable compensation awarded is determined based on the HRC and Board’s assessment of the Company’s and CEO’s performance. Once determined, total variable compensation is delivered as a cash bonus and long-term equity (PSAs and RSRs). The value our CEO will realize from PSAs and RSRs is a function of our future performance (for PSAs), his continuing service with the Company, and stock price. \\nIn February 2022, the HRC reviewed CEO target total compensation for Wells Fargo against each of the labor market peers relative to a comparison of revenue, assets, and market capitalization. As illustrated by the table below, CEO target total compensation did \\nnot fully reflect the size and scale of Wells Fargo in terms of revenue, assets, and market cap. The size metrics are widely used by our industry and those who follow it to quantify size, scale, and complexity on a consistent basis. In referencing market data, the HRC does not target a specific percentile, but, instead, uses data as a reference point. A summary of the pay and size analysis the HRC considered in its market assessment is summarized below. \\nWells Fargo vs Labor Market Peers: \\nCEO Total Compensation (“TC”) and Select Size Metrics (as of 12/31/2021) by Percentiles \\n \\n$20B $51B $69B \\nAssets \\n$0.5T $0.9T $2.1T \\nMarket Cap \\n$84B $122B $164B Key: $ 2021 Wells Fargo $ 2022 Wells Fargo \\n25th %tile 50th %tile 75th %tile \\nCEO Total \\nCompensation $27M $23M \\n2021 Target TC 2022 Target TC$17M $26M $34M \\nRevenue $78B \\n$1.9T \\n$186B \\nBased on this analysis, the HRC determined that the CEO’s target total compensation was not sufficiently aligned with peer pay \\nlevels.

The entire value of the increase in 2022 target total compensation was delivered through an increase in target variable compensation, subject to performance. This outcome reflected the HRC’s desire to appropriately align our CEO’s total compensation with the Labor Market Peer Group, while allowing for year-to-year variability in actual CEO pay as determined by the performance-based nature of the program. \\nFor 2022, as in prior years, the HRC also reviewed and approved the other NEOs’ target total compensation, informed by Labor \\nMarket Peer \\nGroup compensation practices. Those annual targets reflect the size, scale, and complexity of our business and the skills \\nand experiences needed to deliver against the Company’s strategic pillars. Such compensation opportunities support the Company’s \\nstrategic plan to generate long-term value consistent with the interests of shareholders. For performance year 2022, the HRC increased target total compensation for Mr. Weiss and Mr. Powell, reflecting the HRC’s evaluation of market pay levels and a review of their performance and responsibilities. Target total compensation remained unchanged from 2021 for the other NEOs. \\nFinancial Performance Peer Group \\nOur current Financial Performance Peer Group is comprised of a subset of Global Systemically Important Banks selected by the HRC to best reflect those companies that compete with us for capital and customers, and are most similar to us in terms of scope, scale, regulatory requirements, and business mix.

This process \\naligns variable compensation determinations with performance against the Company’s long-term value drivers and prudent risk oversight, and provides the HRC with the ability to reduce an individual NEO’s performance achievement level for material failu res in \\nrisk management, including but not limited to misconduct. For DE&I, the HRC evaluates the CEO’s progress on key Company-wide DE&I priorities, and for other NEOs, the HRC uses progress on diverse representation and inclusion across specific underreprese nted \\ngroups of NEO senior leadership teams, with potential adjustments to variable compensation based on a holistic assessment of progress increasing representation in these groups. \\n1 Set Goals \\nStrategic Pillars and Categories of Performance \\nOur Board sets our strategic direction and risk appetite, including approval of our strategic plan annually. The strategic plan includes our five strategic pillars, which in turn are used to frame the goals the HRC uses to assess Company, individual, and, as appli cable, line \\nof business performance. Three of the strategic pillars – Risk and Control Culture, Operational Excellence, and Customer-Centri c \\nCulture and Conduct – focus on advancing our risk and control culture, supported by Technology and Innovation (4th pillar), to collectively drive our top priority of building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for our size and complexity, and Financial Strength (5th pillar). \\nThe HRC uses a rigorous approach in establishing performance goals that incentivize NEOs to deliver on the Company’s strategic \\npriorities. At the beginning of each year, individual NEO goals are set with a focus on supporting broader Company goals. The g oals \\nare tailored and specific to each NEO’s area of responsibility. At the end of the year, each NEO’s performance is evaluated aga inst \\nthe pre-established performance goals.

At the \\nend of the year, the HRC assesses Company and individual NEO performance against the specific financial and non-financial goals set at the beginning of the year. In the case of the CEO, the performance assessment included a detailed review of performance for \\neach of the pre-established goals under the above-mentioned broad categories. The performance assessment is shared with the HRC. The HRC then assesses the CEO’s performance in an executive session without him present.

Finally, the HRC assigns achievement levels that include risk considerations for overall Company and individual \\nNEO performance, and business performance for NEOs who head one of our lines of business. \\nFor 2022, the HRC focused on our NEOs’ progress in strengthening our risk and control infrastructure, which includes addressing \\nopen historical and emerging issues, and advancing our business through technology and innovation to increase internal operational \\nefficiency so we can deploy resources to better serve our customers and communities. These two areas play significant roles in how \\nwe define short-term and long-term success, and accordingly, played a significant role in the HRC’s holistic assessment of performance and determination of variable compensation. We anticipate that the HRC’s focus on these two areas will continue for the foreseeable future to help drive the Company’s transformation. \\nIn addition, as part of the performance assessment, the CRO provides an independent risk assessment  for each of the NEOs\\n , other  \\nthan the CEO.

Further, each NEO is assessed on driving measurable progress towards advancing the Company’s risk and control environment, which includes resolving outstanding regulatory matters and commitments. The risk assessments are incorporated into each NEO’s overall performance assessment, and the HRC may reduce or eliminate an NEO’s variable compensation for the applicable performance \\nyear due to risk failures, as well as other actions under the Clawback and Forfeiture Policy  depending on the impact of adverse risk \\noutcomes. \\n3 Determine Pay \\nAs discussed in last year’s CD&A, effective for performance year 2021, the HRC approved a new approach to determine each NEO’s \\ntotal compensation, defined as the sum of base salary and total variable compensation.  Under this approach, Company and \\nindividual NEO achievement levels, including line of business performance (as applicable), are considered by the HRC to determine total performance achievement, which then determines the quantum of the total variable compensation. Once the total variable compensation is determined, it is delivered through the pre-set pay mix.

These objectives are achieved by \\nsubjecting long-term equity awards to our Clawback and Forfeiture Policy . The value ultimately realized from any long-term equity \\ngrant is also a function of the number of shares that vest and our stock price at the time of vesting and settlement. Finally, PSAs \\ncarry additional performance requirements tied to our absolute and relative ROTCE and a TSR modifier based on our performance relative to our Financial Performance Peer Group . \\nAbsolute and relative ROTCE are used as the primary performance conditions in our PSAs. Effective for PSAs granted in 2023 for \\n2022 performance, the HRC increased the absolute ROTCE performance level at the target and maximum payout levels. For the relative ROTCE component, the HRC set the target objective at the median of the Financial Performance Peer Group, recognizing the meaningful increase in our ROTCE that would be required to improve our relative performance. Finally, and starting with the PSAs granted in 2022 (based on 2021 performance), the HRC added an award payout modifier of +/-20% based on our relative TSR over the three-year performance period. The TSR modifier supports management accountability for our relative stock price performance at the end of the performance period for which an award is earned.  \\n2023 PSA Program \\nOur PSA program appropriately balances the importance of absolute and relative performance while maintaining rigorous performance targets.

The Deferred Compensation Plan also provides for supplemental Company-matching contributions related to any compensation deferred by a plan participant, including named executives, that would have been eligible (up to certain IRS limits) but for this deferral, for a matching contribution under the 401(k) Plan. As of December 31, 2022, n one of \\nour NEOs were participating in the Deferred Compensation Plan. \\nWachovia Elective Deferral Plan and Wachovia Savings Restoration Plan \\nAs a former Wachovia executive, Mr. Weiss participated in the Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan and the Wachovia Savings \\nRestoration Plan. Participation in these plans was frozen and contributions ceased for the Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan, effective December 31, 2008, and for the Wachovia Savings Restoration Plan, effective December 31, 2007. \\nThe Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan is a frozen, unfunded, nonqua lified deferred compensation plan that allowed certain highly \\ncompensated employees to defer base salary and/or incentive paym ents on a pre-tax basis until a future date (generally retireme nt, \\ndeath, or separation from service). The terms of the plan required participants to irrevocably elect the form of payment (eithe r in \\ninstallments or in a lump sum) and permitted early withdrawal of account balances in the case of an unforseeable emergency resu lting in \\nsevere financial hardship.

Although Ms. Mack’s equity awards generally qualify for retirement treatment, the January 25, 2022 RSR award of 18,661 didn’t contain such retirement provisions. For Mr. Scharf, retirement means the termination of employment (i) after reaching age 55 with five completed years of service or (ii) based on such more favorable treatment as may apply under the practices of the Company in effect from time to time.

The Company’s independent auditor is responsible for performing independent audits of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These audits serve as a basis for the independent auditor’s opinions included in the Company’s annual report to shareholders addressing whether the financial statements fairly present our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

In evaluating KPMG’s independence, the Audit Committee takes into consideration the mandatory rotation of each of the lead audit partner and concurring partner on the engagement team every five years and the rotation of other key audit partners as required under applicable SEC rules and regulations. \\nThe Audit Committee is involved in the selection of, and reviews and evaluates, the lead \\naudit partner as part of its oversight activities. The Audit Committee believes this level of rotation within the audit engagement team is a key factor to help ensure the independence of perspective in connection with the audit engagement. During 2020, the Audit Committee oversaw the rotation of the Company’s lead audit partner from KPMG. \\nThe Audit Committee recognizes the significant value of (1) maintaining a fresh \\nperspective with KPMG’s audit engagement while at the same time benefitting from KPMG’s extensive experience in the financial services industry and with the breadth and complexity of the Company and our businesses, and (2) avoiding the potential risks associated with appointing a new independent auditor, including the management time commitment, costs, and inefficiencies involved with onboarding a new independent auditor. \\nActive Audit Committee Oversight of Independent Auditor The Audit Committee meets regularly with KPMG both with management and in executive session at its regularly scheduled meetings throughout the year. The Audit Committee chair also meets separately with KPMG in between meetings as necessary and appropriate. \\nLimits on Non-Audit Services The Audit Committee exercises sole authority to approve all audit engagement fees and terms associated with the retention of KPMG and receives reporting from management on audit fee negotiations and performance against the audit plan. As discussed further below, the Audit Committee also has a strict policy in place that prohibits KPMG from providing certain non-audit services to Wells Fargo and requires all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by KPMG to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. \\nKPMG’s Internal Processes and Procedures to Safeguard Independence KPMG maintains internal processes and procedures with respect to maintaining its independence as the Company’s independent auditor.

Audit Committee policy prohibits KPMG from providing certain \\nnon-audit services to us and requires all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by KPMG to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. There are three methods for pre-approving KPMG services. \\n•\\t The Audit Committee may pre-approve, on an annual basis, recurring  services such as the audits of our annual financial stateme nts and \\ninternal control over financial reporting and the review of ou r quarterly financial statements. Preliminary fee levels will not  exceed \\namounts pre-approved for these services in the preceding calendar year, and a subsequent refinement of the actual fees incurred as a \\nresult of changes in the scope of servic es will be submitted to the Audit Committee for pre-approval. The Audit Committee or a \\ndesignee must pre-approve changes in the scope of recurring servic es if they will result in fee increases in excess of a relati vely small \\namount established by the Audit Committee prior to such additional services being provided by KPMG. Changes in the scope of pre-approved services with estimated costs less than that amount may be approved by the Chief Accounting Officer and Controller . \\n•\\t The Audit Committee may pre-approve, for a particular calendar year, specific types of audit, audit-related, advisory, consulting, or tax services that could arise with respect to that calendar year that were not already pre-approved as recurring services, s ubject \\nto a fee cap for each category for that year. The Audit Committee also provided the Chief Accounting Officer with 2023 pre\\xadapproval authority for audit, audit related, tax, and other services including services subject to the annual cap fee for each \\ncategory of up to $1 million, $350 ,000, and $500,000, respectively. \\n•\\t The Audit Committee may pre-approve, from time to time during the year, services that have neither been pre-approved as recurring services nor pre-approved pursuant to the categorical pre-approval described above. \\nIn determining whether to pre-approve the provision by KPMG of a permissible non-audit service, the Audit Committee considers the \\nfacts and circumstances of the engagement, in cluding other non-audit services provided by KPMG and the fees for those services, \\nand whether the provision of the non-audit service by KPMG could impair the independence of KPMG with respect to us.

This includes any existing supermajority vote requirement that result form default to state law and can be subject to replacement. \\nShareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting \\nrequirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to “What Matters in Corporate Governance” by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements are used to block proposals supported by most shareholders but opposed by a status quo management. \\nThis proposal topic won form 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, \\nMcGraw-Hill and Macy’s.

This provision is intended to benefit shareholders by limiting hostile takeovers and applies to approximately 90% of S&P 500 Delaware companies.\\n1 \\n•\\t Adopting a majority of votes cast standard (i.e., votes “for” must exceed votes “against”) for all matters is also unnecessary as most matters submitted to our holders of common stock require only the support of the majority of shares present and entitled to vote (i.e., votes “for” must exceed (a) votes “against” plus (b) abstentions). \\n•\\t Our Company has a demonstrated commitment to strong corporate governance practices, and a demonstrated record of responsiveness to our shareholders. \\n1  Based on a review of FactSet data as of February 9, 2023. \\n2023 Proxy Statement 105', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Shareholder Proposals \\nOur Board believes that the two supermajority voting standards involving our common stock are appropriately narrow and \\napplicable in only limited circumstances that are designed to protect the interests of our shareholders. \\n1. \\t Local Director By-Law Amendment. There is only one explicit supermajority vote requirement involving our common stock in the Company’s governance documents. Under our By-Laws, 80% of the holders of our common stock are required to amend a historical By-Law provision requiring that the Company vote in favor of local directors for certain financial services company subsidiaries. Notably, this provision only applies if, among other things, the Company agrees to be bound by the requirement when acquiring the stock of such bank subsidiaries. Furthermore, only the Company and other holders of equity in the Company’s subsidiaries, if applicable, may vote for the election of directors for such subsidiaries. \\n2. \\tDelaware Law Default. The only other supermajority requirement relates to a Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) \\nprovision, which by default requires supermajority approval for certain interested shareholder transactions. This requirement is consistent with best practices in the market and applies to approximately 90% of Delaware-incorporated S&P 500 companies, including all of the Company’s Delaware peers, none of which have elected to opt out of this provision.\\n2 This provision is \\nappropriately intended to ensure that there is significant support before a transaction with an interested shareholder is effected. \\nIn addition, the Board believes that the proposal’s request for adoption of a majority of votes cast standard for all matters presented to shareholders will not be meaningful, as the existing majority vote standard is sufficient and appropriately protects shareholder interests. Under the Company’s current governance standards: \\n1. \\n \\n \\t directors are elected by a simple  majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections; \\n2. \\t most matters presented at a shareholder meeting are otherwise determined by a simple majority of common stock shares \\npresent and entitled to vote on the subject matter; and \\n3. \\t amendments to our By-Laws require a majority of shares outstanding. \\nFurthermore, our By-Laws and other corporate governance practices reflect sound and effective corporate governance principles \\nand responsiveness to our shareholders. For example: \\n•\\t Our Board amended our By-Laws in 2018 to enhance the rights of our shareholders by reducing the threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders from 25% to 20%; \\n•\\t Our Board amended our By-Laws in 2016 to require that the Chair of the Board be an independent director; \\n•\\t Our Board adopted a standard proxy access By-Law provision in 2015; \\n•\\t Our Board amended our By-Laws in 2011 to allow shareholders to call a special meeting; \\n•\\t Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws permit shareholders to act by written consent by the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote were present and voting; and \\n•\\t All of our Company’s directors are elected annually by a majority vote in uncontested director elections. \\nFor the reasons set out above, including the Company’s proven track record of successfully implementing shareholder-protective governance provisions, the Board believes implementing this proposal is unnecessary. \\nOur Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal (Item 5). \\nItem 5 – Shareholder Proposal – Simple Majority Vote \\nOur Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal \\n2\\t Based on a review of FactSet data as of February 9, 2023. \\n106 Wells Fargo & Company', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 115}),\n",

Major companies have \\nenormous influence and bipartisan credibility to help establish a policy environment that will avert the most dire climate risk s and \\ntake advantage of the opportunity of this generational economic shift. Corporate lobbying that is inconsistent with the Paris Agreement poses escalating material risks to companies and investors.\\n6 \\nThe Company committed to advocate for policies that enable client transitions to net zero emissions.7 However, the Company’s \\npositions on and details of engagement with policymakers are unclear.8 A recent letter submitted to the Municipal Advisory Council \\nof Texas shows evidence of the Company’s continued support for investing in fossil fuels.9 The Company’s sponsorship of the State \\nFinancial Officers Foundation, which has been weaponizing state treasurers’ offices against climate-related financial risk management, has been called out by members of Congress.\\n10 \\nOf increasing concern are trade associations and other policy organizations that speak for business but too often present major  \\nobstacles to addressing the climate crisis. The Company is a member of financial industry associations which are opposing emerging sustainable finance policy, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and the California Chamber of Commerce.\\n11 \\nRESOLVED:  Shareholders of Wells Fargo and Company request that the Board of Directors analyze and report to shareholders \\nannually (at reasonable cost, omitting confidential and proprietary information) on whether and how it is aligning its lobbying and policy influence activities and positions, both direct and indirect through trade associations, coalitions, alliances, and othe r \\norganizations, with its public commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 including the activities and positions analyzed , the \\ncriteria used to assess alignment, and involvement of stakeholders, if any, in the analytical process. \\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: In evaluating the degree of alignment between the Company’s emissions goals and its lobbying, the \\nCompany should disclose its direct and indirect policy positions and lobbying actions with regard to climate provisions of key \\ninternational, federal and state legislation and regulation. The Company should consider investor expectations described in the Global Standard on Responsible Climate Lobbying\\n12 as a useful resource for implementation. \\n1 https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg3/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf \\n2 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/window-for-climate-action-closing-fast; \\n3 https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0426', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 118}),\n",

Shareholder Proposals \\nWHEREAS:  The banking sector has a critical role to play in achieving global Net Zero by 2050 goals. The Net Zero Banking Alliance \\n(NZBA) notes that 40 percent of global banking assets have committed to aligning lending and investment portfolios with net zero by 2050.\\n1 But targets alone are insufficient. Investors seek disclosures demonstrating banks’ concrete transition strategies to \\ncredibly achieve their disclosed emission reduction targets. \\nThe United Nations has recommended that financial institution transition plans demonstrate how all parts of the business align with \\ninterim targets and \\nlong-term net zero targets.2 Other guidelines exist to help financial institutions operationalize and translate net \\nzero commitments into strategies “with specific objectives . . . against which progress can be assessed.”3,4 \\nWells Fargo is the third largest global financer of fossil fuels, with $46 billion in fossil fuel financing in 2021, and nearly  $272 billion \\nbetween 2016 through 2021.5 Of the top 3 fossil fuel funders, only Wells increased its fossil fuel funding above 2019 levels.6 \\nRecognizing the need for action, and the importance of achieving global 1.5°C climate goals, Wells is a member of the NZBA. In \\nMarch 2021, Wells announced a Net Zero by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction goal. It also announced five broad areas of focus toward this goal. In addition to its Net Zero target, it disclosed an approach for measuring and annually disclosing its financed emissions; it committed to and has set 2030 reduction targets for the oil & gas and power portfolio sectors; it established an institute for sustainable finance to assist clients achieve GHG emissions reductions; and integrated climate into its risk management framework.\\n7 \\nThese are important and critical first steps. But Wells cannot stop there. Shareholders are concerned that Wells does not have, or does not disclose, a transition plan for how it will achieve its 2030 sectoral reductions targets. An effective transition plan creates bank accountability by describing the affirmative strategies, indicators, milestones, metrics, and timelines necessary to deliver on its decarbonization targets and ensure investors that the bank is fully accountable for the risks associated with its financing of high-carbon activities. \\nA transition plan could include, for example, disclosure of clients’ estimated annual reductions and how the bank plans to achieve \\nremaining reductions. Additional \\nactions may include client and employee incentives or disincentives; setting requirements, \\nincluding loan approval guidelines, investment and underwriting priorities or prohibitions; and policies or guidelines that otherwise restrict, limit, or condition bank business activities, among others. \\nClimate Transition Report – Statement in Opposition \\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, which is identified as Item 8 on the proxy card, for the following reasons: \\n•\\t In March 2021, Wells Fargo announced a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, including financed emissions, by 2050. \\nThen, in May 2022,', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

Organizations like the Science Based Targets initiative and Transition Pathway Initiative can provide independent verification of decarbonization targets. \\nRESOLVED:  Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt a policy for a time-bound phase-out of WFC’s lending and \\nunderwriting to projects and companies engaging in new fossil fuel exploration and development. Supporting Statement: This proposal is intended, in the discretion of board and management, to enable support for WFC’s energy \\nclients’ low-carbon transition. \\n1 https://www.swissre.com/media/press-release/nr-20210422-economics-of-climate-change-risks.html \\n2 https://www.iisd.org/system/files/2022-10/navigating-energy-transitions-mapping-road-to-1.5.pdf \\n3 https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/resources/spm-headline-statements/', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",

In May 2022, we announced an interim reduction target of 26 percent by 2030 (over our 2019 baseline) \\nin emissions attributed to our lending and debt and equity capital markets facilitation for the Oil & Gas sector. \\n•\\t Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires concerted action from a host of stakeholders, including \\nsupportive government policies, public investment, shifts in business models and consumer behavior, and the commercialization of new decarbonizing technologies. As a bank, we are focused on working with clients in a broad range of sectors of the U.S. economy, including the Oil & Gas sector, to provide the financial services needed to support an orderly energy transition. \\n•\\t Oil and gas remain important energy sources; economic forecasts and net-zero scenarios suggest these fossil fuels will remain an important part of the energy mix for decades to come. Recent geopolitical events underscore the need to address energy security and avoid unintended impacts on vulnerable communities. \\n•\\t We do not believe restricting financing to the Oil & Gas sector is reasonable given the significant adverse impact that curtailing financing to this sector would have on the U.S. and world economies. Also, this approach is counterproductive at a time when many of these companies are investing in their own climate transitions, pursuing emissions reductions in their operations, and developing new clean energy solutions. \\n•\\t For all of these reasons, our intent is to continue financing the energy needs of today, which includes the Oil & Gas sector, while appropriately managing associated environmental and social risks and funding the development of cleaner energy sources. Through this approach, we believe Wells Fargo can play our part in helping to facilitate an orderly energy transition. \\nWells Fargo continues to view climate change as one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and we are committed to supporting clients with financial services to facilitate an orderly energy transition and a sustainable future. \\nSince March 2021, we have been taking meaningful steps toward our goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In May \\n2022, we published a methodology to set targets for carbon-intensive sectors and set interim emissions targets for 2030 for our  \\nOil & Gas and Power portfolios aligned to the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Orderly Net Zero 2050 scenario. \\nWith respect to the Oil & Gas sector, Wells Fargo’s interim target was crafted to capture substantially all emissions in the value chain, including those associated with the ultimate consumption of oil and gas produced by our clients (please see CO2eMission\\nSM  \\nfor additional detail). While we evaluate interim reduction targets in other carbon-intensive sectors, we are working in parallel on transition plans to describe the actions we intend to take to meet our Oil & Gas and Power targets. \\nHowever, the policy suggested \\nby the proponents – that we adopt a time-based phase out of lending and underwriting activities \\nthat contribute to new fossil fuel development – runs counter to our efforts to partner with Oil & Gas sector clients in the en ergy \\nindustry’s transformation. Businesses in the Oil & Gas sector predominantly rely on general purpose financing for their operati ons. \\nAs such, adoption of a time-bound phase out of lending to companies involved in oil and gas exploration would effectively precl ude \\nWells Fargo from offering financing to the Oil & Gas sector by an arbitrary end date.

In its discretion, the Board may wish to consider including disclosures such as: \\n•\\t the total number and aggregate dollar amount of disputes settled by the company related to abuse, harassment or discrimination \\nin the previous three years; \\n•\\t the total number of pending harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes, arbitration or litigation; \\n•\\t the aggregate dollar amount associated with the enforcement of arbitration clauses; \\n•\\t the number of enforceable contracts which include concealment clauses that restrict discussions of harassment or discrimination, and \\n•\\t the aggregate dollar amount associated with agreements which contain concealment clauses. \\nConcealment clauses are defined as any employment or post-employment agreement, such as arbitration, non-disclosure or non-disparagement agreements, that the Company asks employees to sign which would limit their ability to discuss unlawful acts in \\nthe workplace, including harassment and discrimination. \\nThis report should not include the names of accusers or details of their settlements without their consent and should be prepared at \\na reasonable cost and omit any information that is proprietary, privileged, or violative of contractual obligations \\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT \\nPersistent controversies have surrounded Wells Fargo’s workforce management. Most recently, its hiring practices came under \\nscrutiny when it was reported that the Company conducted interviews of diverse candidates for positions that had already been filled and subsequent retaliation against those employees that complained about the sham interviews. It has also been reported that \\nthe United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York’s criminal division is investigating possible violations of federal laws based on this reporting. \\nThe Securities Exchange Commission has shown increased attention to human capital management issues, as demonstrated by its \\n2020 rulemaking and the Chairman’s public comments about future, more proscriptive disclosure rulemaking. There have been several high-profile derivative suits settled recently, including at Twentieth Century Fox, Wynn Resorts, and Alphabet, alleging boards breached their duties by failing to protect employees from discrimination and harassment, injuring the companies and the ir \\nshareholders. \\nA public report such as the one requested would assist shareholders in assessing whether the Company is improving its workforce \\nmanagement. Civil rights violations within the workplace can result in substantial costs to companies, including fines and pena lties, \\nlegal costs, costs related to absenteeism, and reduced productivity. A company’s failure to properly manage its workforce can have significant ramifications, making it more difficult to retain and recruit employees, and jeopardize relationships with customers and other partners. \\nAnnual Report on Prevention of Workplace Harassment and Discrimination – Statement in \\nOpposition \\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, which is identified as Item 10 on the proxy card, for the following reasons:', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 124}),\n",

We provide \\nmultiple avenues for employees to raise concerns (including an anonymous option) and our policies prohibit retaliation of any kind against anyone for providing information in good faith (or otherwise in accordance with applicable country-specific laws). \\nThe Company’s commitments in this area are reinforced and communicated through employee training programs. U.S. employees are required to complete anti-harassment and discrimination training annually.

The Company regularly assesses its workforce management as part of providing a safe, healthy, and accessible environment to employees. \\nWhile our goal is prevention, when an allegation of discrimination or harassment is made, the Company’s policies require that we thoroughly and objectively investigate it and take appropriate action, up to and including termination of any employee found to have engaged in inappropriate conduct.

We do not impose a non-disclosure or confidentiality requirement on employees who participate in arbitration, nor does arbitration restrict an employee from filing a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or appropriate state agency.

The policy should: \\n• Be applicable to Wells Fargo’s direct operations and subsidiaries globally; \\n• Include a commitment to non-interference when employees exercise their right to form or join trade unions; \\n•\\t Prohibit any member of management or agent of Wells Fargo from undermining the right to form or join trade unions or \\npressuring any employee from exercising this right; \\n•\\t Describe the ongoing due diligence process Wells Fargo will use to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for any violations of \\nthese rights, including how it will remedy any misaligned practices. \\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT \\nFreedom of association and the effective right to collective bargaining are internationally recognized human rights according to the \\nInternational Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, Wells Fargo’s Human Rights Statement, Code of Conduct, and Supplier Code of Conduct are silent on Wells Fargo’s obligations to respect the international human rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining. \\nIn February 2022, Wells Fargo published “Priority Recommendations of the Wells Fargo Human Rights Impact Assessment and \\nActions in Response” that summarized a human rights impact assessment performed by a third party law firm. The recommendations stated that “Wells Fargo should consider prioritizing the issuance of a comprehensive human rights policy and providing training to the bank’s leadership and senior management regarding the [United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights].” \\nIn response to lawmakers’ questions at a U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing on September 22, \\n2022 and a U.S. House Committee on Financial Services hearing on September 21, 2022, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf declined to \\ncommit to remain neutral if Wells Fargo’s employees seek to unionize. And on June 15, 2022, an unfair labor practice charge was filed with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Wells Fargo discharged an employee in retaliation for exercising her freedom of association rights.\\n1 \\nWe believe this resolution will also help address human rights risks at Wells Fargo’s operations in other countries. Wells Farg o’s largest \\ninternational operations are in India and the Philippines. The 2022 ITUC Global Rights Index rated India and the Philippines as \\ncountries with no guarantee of rights, explaining that such coun tries are “the worst countries in  the world to work in. While t he \\nlegislation may spell out certain rights, workers have effectivel y no access to these rights and are therefore exposed to autoc ratic \\nregimes and unfair labour practices.”2 \\nFor these reasons, we urge shareholders to vote FOR this resolution. \\nPolicy on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining – Statement in Opposition \\nOur Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal, which is identified as Item 11 on the proxy card, for the following \\nreasons: \\n•\\t We respect employees’ rights under applicable local laws related to freedom of association and collective bargaining.

       " Document(page_content='Notes on Non-GAAP Financial \\nMeasures \\nWe evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP \\nfinancial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. One of these ratios is return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that ROTCE is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. \\nFor purposes of measuring performance, as provided in our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) or the applicable form of award agreement, ROTCE may be further adjusted by the Human Resources Committee, in its discretion, for the effect of (i) losses resulting from discontinued operations, (ii) the cumulative effect of significant changes in generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii) any other unusual or infrequeently occurring gain or loss which is separately identified and quantified. Under the terms of Mr. Scharf’s offer letter, ROTCE for purposes of his Performance Shares is adjusted to exclude the impact of any penalties or other charges related to litigation, investigations or examinations arising out of retail sales practices of the Company or other material regulatory matters related to the conduct of the Company during periods prior to his employment. \\nIn addition, the HRC believed it was useful to consider certain notable items that occurred during 2022 and 2021 in order to better assess the Company’s underlying financial performance for 2022, including as compared with 2021. Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Noninterest Expense, Adjusted Pre-Tax Provision Profit, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted ROE, Adjusted ROTCE, and Adjusted Efficiency Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures and represent our reported financial results adjusted for these notable items. We believe that these adjusted financial measures are useful because they enabled the HRC as well as management, investors, and others to better assess the Company’s underlying financial performance for 2022, particularly for the purposes of analyzing 2022 compensation decisions. \\n2022 Notable Items \\n•\\t Operating losses: litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters related to a variety of historical matters of $2.0 billion (pre-tax) and $3.3 billion (pre-tax) in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively \\n•\\t Change in allowance for credit losses: decrease of $75 million, excluding the impact of net charge-offs \\n2021 Notable Items \\n•\\t Change in allowance for credit losses: decrease of $5.7 billion, excluding the impact of net charge-offs \\n•\\t Divestitures: revenue (including gain on sales) of $3.0 billion and expenses of $1.3 billion associated with the sales of Wells Fargo Asset Management, our Corporate Trust Services business, and our student loan portfolio \\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. \\n2023 Proxy Statement 127', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2023-proxy-statement.pdf', 'page': 136}),\n",

Over 400 million people have been infected with the virus, almost 6 million people have died, and so many others have been impacted in diferent ways. At the same time, we are learning to coexist with COVID-19. We now have multiple vaccines and a clearer understanding of how to protect ourselves from infection. \\nWells Fargo has used its strength to provide support \\nthrough this crisis to our employees, customers, and communities, and we will continue to do so. We recognize that the pandemic has left many people in need, and that those needs haven’t gone away. As a company, we will continue to provide support to a diverse set of stakeholders over the long term. \\nAlongside these eforts, the work we have been doing \\nto transform Wells Fargo has made us an even stronger company than we were a year ago. It has put us in a position to support a broad set of stakeholders, and it has positively impacted our results. While we still have much more to do, our foundation is stronger, our business is more focused, we are driving cultural change, the talent and management process changes we have made are making a positive impact, and our fnancial performance is stronger. \\n2021 Annual Report II', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Financial performance \\nThe work we have been doing to improve our financial profile is beginning to impact our results. In 2021, Wells Fargo generated $21.5 billion in net income, or $4.95 per common share. This included a $5.7 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses which improved earnings by $1.05 per common share. \\nOur revenue increased 6% from the \\nprevious year, with lower net interest income more than ofset by growth in noninterest income. We benefted from strong gains in our afliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains from the sales of our student lending, asset management, and corporate trust businesses, which we do not expect to repeat in 2022. But we also had broad-based revenue growth across our businesses, including in Home Lending, Consumer & Small Business Banking, credit cards, Auto lending, Commercial Real Estate, investment banking, and Wealth & Investment Management.   \\nExpenses declined 7% from a year ago, \\nrefecting lower operating losses and progress on our efciency initiatives – and this is while we added to our investments to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure and made other investments to build out new products and capabilities for our customers. \\nCredit quality improved signifcantly \\nas we saw strong economic growth and our customers had high levels of liquidity. Our net charge-of rate declined from 35 basis points in 2020 to 18 basis points in 2021, and, as noted above, our allowance for credit losses declined by $5.7 billion. \\nLoans outstanding increased 1% \\nfrom a year ago. Loans declined in the frst half of the year but grew 5% in the second half, with growth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Average deposits in 2021 grew $61.8 billion, or 4%, from a year ago as declines in commercial deposits, driven by our actions to remain under the asset cap, were more than ofset by growth in consumer deposits. \\nWe also returned a significant \\namount of capital to our shareholders, $16.9 billion in total. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share in the third quarter and then to $0.25 in the first quarter of 2022. In total, we returned $2.4 billion through common stock dividends in 2021 and repurchased $14.5 billion of common stock, predominantly in the second half of 2021, after the return to the stress capital bufer framework. \\nOur return on equity was 12.0% and \\nour return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 14.3%, which is close to our stated goal of about 15% over time ¹. \\nExcluding the reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 2021, ROTCE would have been 11.2%². In addition, we had several other items which benefted our results, such as very strong equity gains, extremely low charge-of rates, and the \\n1.

We said at the beginning of 2021 that we see a clear path to achieving a sustainable 10% ROTCE, and we believe we will achieve that, subject to the same assumptions we’ve discussed in the past, on a run rate basis at some point in 2022. We have also said that after achieving this, we will target approximately 15% sustainable ROTCE. We continue to believe that our franchise is capable of producing signifcantly higher returns, and we remain focused on achieving them while continuing to invest in our infrastructure and in our capabilities to serve our customers. \\nThe strong economy continues \\nto positively impact our customers and our results  Consumers’ fnancial position remained strong throughout the pandemic. While median deposit balances declined during the second half of 2021, after Economic Impact Payments ended, consumers continued to have more liquidity than prior to the pandemic, with median balances at the end of the year 26% higher than pre-pandemic levels.  \\nConsumer credit card spend continued \\nto be strong, with general purpose credit card spending up 27% in 2021 compared with 2020 and up 17% from pre-COVID 2019 levels. The spending categories most impacted by COVID in 2020 – travel, fuel, and entertainment – all rebounded by more than 50% in 2021. Across all sectors, travel was the only one that was still down from 2019 levels; however, travel spending improved throughout 2021 and nearly doubled from 2020 levels. \\nConsumer debit card spend also \\ncontinued to be strong, with spending up 20% compared with 2020 and up 28% from 2019 levels. All spending categories increased in 2021, except for a modest decline in food and drug. Discretionary spending on retail goods continued to be strong relative to both 2020 and 2019 as customer liquidity levels remained high. \\nWhile loan demand was weak early \\nin the year, loans grew 5% in the second half with growth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. We saw strong growth in auto and also had strong loan growth in Corporate & Investment Banking, with loans up 16% from a year ago. \\nWe have made significant progress \\nover the past two years I’ve been at the company for a little over two years and believe we are a very different company today than when I arrived. Though we have much more to do, overall, I feel great about what we’ve accomplished in an incredibly difcult operating environment. \\nI think about our areas of progress along \\nseveral dimensions: \\n• Risk, control, and regulatory • Talent and leadership • Financial and strategic progress • ESG and company reputation • Customer centricity \\n2021 Annual Report IV', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Risk, control, and regulatory \\nWe began a process two years ago to change the culture and priorities of the company. The most signifcant part of this was prioritizing the development and implementation of an appropriate risk and control framework across the company. Our approach to managing this is entirely diferent than when I arrived, and I believe we are making signifcant progress. We are laser-focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators. We work to have clear plans in place and clear owners for each regulatory deliverable we have. We have detailed reporting on how we’re progressing on those plans. We review this reporting weekly at the Operating Committee. Our executives are expected to be actively engaged in the details and are accountable for getting the work done properly and timely.  \\nOur ability to identify risk and control issues has also improved from two years ago. We have reached numerous regulatory milestones over the past year. These include: \\n• The OCC’s January 2021 termination of a 2015 consent order related to the company’s \\nBank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) compliance program \\n• The September 2021 expiration of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) consent \\norder issued in 2016 regarding the bank’s retail sales practices \\n• The OCC’s January 2022 termination of a consent order issued in June 2015 regarding add-on \\nproducts that the company sold to retail banking customers before 2015  \\nDespite reaching these milestones, we still have much more work to do. We need to implement \\nthe many plans we have developed, some of which contain several years’ worth of work, and also demonstrate their sustainability. We have multiple checkpoints along the way before we turn the completed work over to our regulators for their review. All of this takes time. An additional complexity is the number of issues and consent orders we are working through simultaneously, which translates into both a high volume of work and a high amount of interdependencies across multiple streams of work. We strive to complete the work accurately and timely, and while we continue to improve our execution, we don’t always meet all of our goals. \\nThe reality is that while I feel good about our progress since I joined the company, many of the \\nconsent orders that remain open have been outstanding for too long. Wells Fargo has been too slow in building and implementing appropriate risk and control frameworks, and the company has been too slow in addressing legacy issues. As a result, in September 2021, the OCC assessed a fne and imposed a new consent order related to loss mitigation activities in our Home Lending business and insufcient progress in addressing requirements under a consent order the agency issued to us in 2018. \\nUntil our broad book of risk, control and regulatory work is complete, we remain at risk for setbacks. \\nHaving said that, I remain confdent in our ability to continue to close our remaining gaps over the next several years. We are committed to completing the work, and I believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in place will enable us to get the work done. \\nV', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Talent and leadership \\nWe have a new management team running Wells Fargo. Since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019, 11 of 16 Operating Committee members are new to the company. Additionally, well over half of the senior most people at our company, meaning those who are one level below the Operating Committee, are new to their roles, and a signifcant proportion of them were hired from outside the company. This is a dramatic change in our leadership and to the group of people responsible for driving the cultural and process changes required for our transformation. We have recruited highly qualifed people with experience in their areas of expertise and have promoted talented leaders within Wells Fargo. \\nWe’ve also signifcantly changed how we run the company. We have regular detailed \\nbusiness reviews, we prioritize resources across the entire company, and we ensure that we diferentiate the performance of our people, rewarding strong performers and coaching those who need to improve. We expect people to prioritize what’s right for our customers, we value execution, and we embrace direct conversations that push us to improve. We celebrate our success but focus on what we can do to improve. \\nFinancial and strategic progress \\nAfter a strategic review in 2020 that resulted in the sale or reductions of several of our businesses, we are making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We are just now beginning to bring to market diferentiated products and services. The number of signifcant opportunities ahead is exciting, but we are only at the beginning of building the culture necessary to transform how we compete in today’s world. \\nI can’t say it enough – job one has been and will continue to be building and implementing \\nan appropriate risk and control infrastructure across the company, embedding changes in our culture, and doing the work with urgency. But we are also investing in our strategic positioning. \\nThough our market shares remain strong, we have been slow in improving and \\nexpanding our capabilities to compete with the best banks and non-banks across all of our businesses. This is changing. All of our lines of business have signifcant opportunities to meaningfully grow, and we are investing in long-term plans to move our franchise forward. There is more competition than ever before, but I continue to feel great about our competitive position and energized about the opportunities in front of us.  \\nConsumer digital \\nAn example is our consumer mobile platform. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced a rebuilt mobile banking experience for Consumer & Small Business customers, and we began rolling it out in the frst quarter of 2022. It has a new, modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs. Though digital adoption has been \\nVI \\n2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='increasing – in the fourth quarter our customers \\nlogged in 1.6 billion times using a mobile device, up 7% year over year, and teller transactions remained more than 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels – we believe that an improved platform can drive signifcantly higher digital adoption from our customers. \\nWe also announced that later this year we will \\nbe adding an all-new virtual assistant – named “Fargo” – to our mobile app. Customers will be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions and ask Fargo to complete a task for them. Fargo will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their fnances. \\nWe also introduced the frst phase of the \\nredesign of our public website early this year. \\nIn addition, we are beginning to become more \\nactive in creating new digital solutions on the wholesale side of our business. For example, we announced that we are collaborating with HSBC to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchain-based solution, which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs. \\nCards and payments \\nWe are approaching payments and credit cards very diferently. We believe credit cards will remain important as both a credit and payment vehicle and are investing in our capabilities. We are also doing additional work around non-card payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key fnancial services provider. \\nTwo years ago, our credit card products \\nand capabilities were not as competitive as necessary. In 2021, we launched two new credit card products, including Active Cash\\nSM, \\nwhich has been referred to as the best cash back card in the marketplace, and Reflect\\nSM, \\nwhich rewards customers for on-time payments. We improved the core credit card experience, including investing in advertising, simplifying our digital application, and enhancing our underwriting and customer service. These eforts have driven an increase in digital card activation and enrollment in paperless statements and alerts. We are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were before launching these products, and importantly, we are not competing on credit. In fact, the credit quality of applications and accounts we are now booking is consistently stronger than what we were booking prior to launch. \\nAway from card, we are investing in digital \\npayments across the platform, enhancing our capabilities, increasing limits, and broadly reducing the friction in moving money. As evidence, Zelle momentum continued to accelerate in 2021, with Zelle transactions up 56% year over year, and Zelle dollar volume up 66%. In the fourth quarter alone, Zelle dollar volume increased 12% from the prior quarter. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending and \\nWealth & Investment Management We have one of the strongest consumer franchises in the largest consumer fnancial services market in the world. The strength of the franchise is still incredible when you consider the stresses that the past several years have placed on the industry and our company. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending \\nWe serve approximately 64 million consumer banking and lending customers, and our bank branch footprint remains a competitive advantage. We have nearly 4,800 retail bank branches, with a presence in 25 of the largest 30 markets in the U.S. ³ A Wells Fargo branch \\nor ATM is within 2 miles of over half of U.S. Census households and small businesses in our footprint. In parallel, as consumers increasingly shift their banking transactions to digital \\n3.

       " Document(page_content='channels, in 2021 we had 33 million \\ndigital active customers, up 3% from 2020, and we had 27.3 million mobile active users, up 5% from 2020. \\nFull year 2021 average deposits \\nin Consumer Banking and Lending totaled $834.7 billion, up from $722.1 billion a year earlier. For full year 2021, we had $471.5 billion in debit card purchase volume, up 20% from $391.9 billion in 2020, and 9.8 billion debit card purchase transactions, up 12% from 8.8 billion in 2020. \\nIn our Home Lending businesses, \\nwe had $205 billion in total originations in 2021, down from $222.7 billion in 2020, driven by an increase in rates and a drop in application volume. Credit card point-of-sale volume was $102.5 billion in 2021, up 26% from $81.6 billion in 2020, in part driven by the launch of our new credit card products. We originated $33.9 billion in auto loans in 2021, up 49% from $22.8 billion in 2020. While auto loan originations have benefted from enhancements we’re making to our capabilities, we continue to be cautious about the increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so and have maintained our underwriting standards. \\nWealth & Investment \\nManagement (WIM) Our WIM business has over 12,300 advisors who serve 2.8 million clients. At the end of 2021, total client assets reached a record $2.2 trillion, up 9% from $2.0 trillion in 2020, primarily due to higher market valuations. We have worked over the past year to simplify our go-to-market strategy within WIM and are investing in our independent and digital channels to complement our existing capabilities. Those eforts will continue into 2022. \\nTaking a step back and looking \\nbroadly across our consumer businesses, we have been focused for several years in consumer banking and lending on remediating sales practices issues. This has been a must. But we have been slow to develop new products, segment our customer base, and develop tailored oferings for each. We still have great opportunity to drive digital adoption to further our eforts to become more efcient and target diferent customers. And we have signifcant opportunities to integrate our consumer businesses across our wealth, consumer lending, and payments oferings. \\nOur belief is that we have the key \\ningredients to compete and be the primary provider for fnancial services for the consumer. Being the primary provider for payments is critical for the mass consumer base, and our deposit, lending and investment products round out our oferings. For the more afuent, our wealth and lending capabilities are critical, and deposits and payments round out those offerings. How we deliver these capabilities is critical – in our branches, on our mobile app, on our native browser, via telephone, and in person. Our capabilities have to be diferentiated by customer segment. \\nWe have the resources to take this \\nintegrated approach, and to build the best consumer platform – but to do this we need to work across our individual consumer businesses, which we have not always done historically. \\nVIII 2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The boundaries between our lines of business are necessary to bring relevant expertise to bear, \\nbut these boundaries are artifcial and cannot stand in the way of making us approach the customer holistically. Like most banks, we have historically delivered our products and services based on how we were organized – not how the customer has wanted to work with us. This is changing and will allow us to compete diferently than we have in the past. \\nCommercial Banking and Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) \\nWe manage Commercial Banking and Corporate & Investment Banking as separate lines of business, but they ofer many of the same products and should share capabilities with common platforms. Here too we are looking past artifcial boundaries. We are combining Treasury Services platforms, and we are working with commercial clients to ofer CIB products such as foreign exchange, interest rate swaps, access to public markets, and M&A advisory services.  \\nWe have great market positions in both lines of business and have meaningful opportunities to \\ngrow. \\nIn Commercial Banking, we serve three core segments: emerging middle-market, middle market \\nand mid-corporate companies. We have over 5,000 bankers and a presence in 49 of the largest 50 markets in the country ⁴. Commercial Banking total loans were $190.3 billion at the end of \\n2021. Deposit growth in Commercial Banking was strong, with average deposits of $197.3 billion in 2021, up 10% from $178.9 billion in the prior year. \\nCIB has been a core part of the company for many years. We have been, and will remain, \\ndisciplined in where we compete, and we continue to grow our business not by changing our risk profle, but by leveraging our core relationships and delivering the entire enterprise to these clients. In 2021, this approach led to growth in banking revenue, up 4% year over year (YoY) to $5.1 billion, primarily driven by higher advisory and debt origination fees, as well as higher loan balances. Broadly speaking, we continue to be focused on leveraging our balance sheet commitments to drive relationships, diversifying our business mix in Capital Markets, and continuing to grow our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) business. Our CRE business is the largest commercial real estate lender in the U.S., and its 2021 revenue was up 10% YoY, to nearly $4 billion. \\nAs we look to grow our business across both Commercial Banking and CIB, we are focused on digital, \\nincluding building out our digital platforms on both the front and back ends. This extends beyond combining our two Treasury Services platforms. It includes a payments modernization program for fnancial institution clients, as well as Integrated Receivables, which we launched last year to simplify payment and remittance data capture, re-association and invoice matching. We are also focused on increasing investment banking revenue from Middle Market clients. \\nTechnology \\nAt the heart of our ability to compete over the long term will be a diferent approach to technology. We think about this along two dimensions. \\n4.

       " Document(page_content='First is creating a platform-based, API-driven architecture that enables similar banking \\nservices to be used across diferent products. Instead of building large applications as we have in the past, this API-driven architecture relies on a nimble set of smaller applications that provide common features and customer data across products and services. It’s a “once built, many times consumed” approach. This won’t happen all at once, but we have a clear path ahead. Over time, our presence will evolve to this model, improving customer experience and allowing us to get new products and services to market more quickly. \\nAs a foundation to this, our Digital Infrastructure Strategy, which we announced in 2021, \\narticulates our approach to moving toward cloud-enabled applications, initially using both public and private cloud solutions and also migrating to a set of modern data centers that will host our private cloud platforms. \\nSecond is a technology-frst approach to our businesses. This is a material change \\nfrom our approach today. We compete with fntech companies where engineers who understand products also design solutions for customers. Wells Fargo, like many other banks, often develops a solution and then asks engineers to build it. We are moving toward an agile approach to development to bring our teams much closer and speed up timelines to get to market. \\nAll of this is good progress, but it’s not enough. As I’ve said before, we need to move from \\nan approach where technology aids our business to where technology drives our business. This is a tough journey, but without it, we signifcantly reduce our chances of success. \\nESG and company reputation \\nWe believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders – in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. Our history has shown this to be true. Consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation. A strong reputation is achieved not just from strong fnancial performance, but from actively supporting employees, customers, and communities – especially those most in need. \\nWe have supported our employees consistently through the pandemic, which I wrote \\nabout at some length in my letter to you last year. In November 2021, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefts and competitive pay to our employees, we would provide supplemental pay from October 2021 to the end of January 2022 to eligible branch employees in active status, in recognition of their contributions during the pandemic. We also announced an increase in U.S. minimum hourly pay levels to a range of $18-22, based on role, location, and market conditions. Over a five-year time period, from 2017-2021, we increased average wages for U.S. hourly employees by nearly 25%. Over the same time period, we increased our investment in U.S. employee benefts by over 20%. \\nX \\n2021 Annual Report', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We have also undertaken significant \\neforts to support consumers and small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic. We supported the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by funding roughly 280,000 loans totaling approximately $14 billion, working with clients of all sizes to provide fexibility and assistance where needed. In addition, we extended forbearance options for over 1 million mortgage customers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nAfter the CARES Act was signed into law, \\nthe government paid fees to those who administered PPP loans. Our belief was that these funds were best used to help small businesses stay open and support employment during the pandemic – not to support our bank. COVID-19 caused a crisis in our communities, not a financial crisis, and we were happy to use our resources to support PPP without fee compensation in 2020. In July 2020, we announced Open for Business, a $420 million fund we created with the gross processing fees we would have earned from processing PPP loans we funded in 2020. We created Open for Business to give back to communities, particularly small businesses, with a focus on those in underserved areas. Wells Fargo has worked with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and local nonprofts across the nation to distribute funding, and to ensure funding occurs at a highly local level. While our work on PPP focused on smaller small businesses most in need, we needed partners to access the broadest set of small businesses in need to facilitate our Open for Business program. \\nWe fulflled our Open for Business commitment \\nin 2021, donating $420 million to organizations that support small businesses during both 2020 and 2021. Our total philanthropic giving in 2021, including both Open for Business dollars and Wells Fargo Foundation giving, was $615 million. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and we have a role to play working with our clients to transform their businesses to carbon-friendly models. Last year we announced our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, including fnanced emissions, by 2050. We also increased our sustainable fnance commitment to $500 billion between 2021 and 2030. In May 2021, we issued our frst sustainability bond, raising $1 billion in capital to support housing afordability, socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, and renewable energy. We expect to announce our first interim fnanced emissions targets for the oil and gas, and power sectors later this year. \\nThis work is bigger than any one company, \\nand we will work across companies and industries as we progress. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an industry-led leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning their fnancing with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. \\nFinally, we recognize that afordable housing \\ncontinues to be one of the top needs in our country. As a company, we use our resources to support afordable, multifamily housing in the U.S., in addition to acting as an active lender for affordable rental housing developments. We remain committed to supporting our customers with homeownership. In 2021, we helped over 585,000 homeowners with new low-rate loans to either purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage. We also closed $2.2 billion in new commitments for afordable housing under the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs.

Our work to advance our digital and mobile presence, to take an agile approach to product development, and to rethink our technology infrastructure are examples of how we’re working to improve the customer experience. \\nBeing customer-centric is not only \\nabout customer experience, though. It’s more fundamentally about how we price and deliver for our customers and meet their fnancial needs. \\nIn January 2022, we announced \\nnew eforts that will roll out over the course of the year to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover short-term cash needs. We are eliminating transfer fees for customers enrolled in Overdraft Protection, eliminating non-sufcient funds fees, giving early access to direct deposit by providing customers access to funds up to two days before a customer’s scheduled deposit, and adding a 24-hour grace period for customers who overdraw their account to cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee. In addition, this year we will introduce a new short-term credit product for customers to meet personal fnancial needs. \\nThese changes build on services that \\nWells Fargo had introduced previously. Clear Access Banking, which we introduced in September 2020, is a consumer bank account that charges no overdraft fees. It now has over 1.1 million outstanding customer accounts. Overdraft Rewind, which was introduced in 2017, automatically reverses overdraft fees when a covering direct deposit is received by the next morning. The service will be replaced with the 24-hour grace period I mentioned above. Wells Fargo also sends more than 1.3 million balance alerts every day to help customers avoid overdrafts. \\nPutting all of our changes in perspective, \\nthese fees are down signifcantly since the fnancial crisis. We have alternatives for both customers that do not want overdraft protection and those that do. This is a competitive marketplace, and we continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customers. Our Office of Consumer Practices, an internal, consumer-focused advisory group that we launched in January 2021, is involved in this work, and plays an important role in helping ensure our products, services, and business practices are fair and transparent. \\nCompetition and what it means for us \\nOur competition is stronger than ever. We compete against some outstanding banks of all sizes. We compete with younger non-banks that have specialized in one part of our business, many of which have moved on to compete more broadly. We also compete with non-banks that have signifcant market capitalizations, and big tech continues to expand its reach into the fnancial services proft pool. \\nSo why do I feel so excited to be at \\nWells Fargo? Simply put, our capabilities allow us to serve consumers and companies with better products at a better value than most anyone else. \\n2021 Annual Report XII', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

Allowed others to build their businesses of of years and years of our investments. These include \\ncompanies that hav e built payments technology and services using bank-developed and supported \\nACH, credit cards, and debit cards. \\n2. Developed products that are designed around how we are organized, not how the customer wants \\nto be serv ed by us. For instance, our deposit, lending, investment, and payments products have not \\nhistorically been on an integrated platf orm. \\n3. Not created user interfaces that are competitive with the best experiences in the marketplace. \\nIn addition, there is a perception that banks do not innovate so regulation should allow these smaller technology focused companies to compete without being subject to the same oversight as regulated banks. \\nWhile others have done well, I still believe that the game is ours to lose. Our customer relationships are \\nextremely valuable, and we remain in a great position to continue to be their primary fnancial services provider, but we must approach their needs diferently. We’ve begun to do that, and I’ve referenced some of these changes earlier in this letter. But there’s more to do. \\nAs we look forward \\nOur game plan remains the same: build a strong risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a company of our size and complexity, run a disciplined business with talented people who remain excited by what Wells Fargo does for its employees, customers and communities, invest for the long term but continue to improve our fnancial performance each year, and realign our business with a technology-frst and true customer-centric viewpoint. \\nWe are unwavering in our commitment to build a strong risk and control foundation. We are committed \\nto invest what’s necessary and continue to do this work with the sense of urgency necessary for our most important priority. But we also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements – with setbacks likely to continue along the way – and will continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us. \\nWe will continue to embrace our responsibility to our employees, customers and communities. I commented earlier that we believe we will achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE – subject to the same \\nassumptions we’ve discussed in the past – on a run rate basis at some point this year, and that once we’ve achieved this goal, we will discuss our plan to continue to increase returns.

Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements”  section, and in the\\xa0“Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” \\nsections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). \\nWhen we refer to “Wells\\xa0Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company.

Wells Fargo ranked No. 37 on Fortune’s\\xa0 2021 \\nrankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at December\\xa031, 2021.\\xa0\\nWells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which could be significant. While we still have significant work to do, the Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. \\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on April\\xa08, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received by the Company from loans made in connection with these programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to nonprofit organizations approved by the FRB that support small businesses. As of December\\xa031, 2021, the Company had not excluded these exposures from the asset cap. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders.

In addition, the consent order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is provided. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters and Other Customer Remediation Activities \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to \\nidentify other areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and implement additional operational and control procedures. We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the probable and estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust efforts, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. \\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters and other customer remediation activities, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nRecent Developments \\nCOVID-19 Pandemic In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of essential services to the public.

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, \\nand Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans guaranteed under a program called the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). We funded approximately $14.0 billion in loans under the PPP. At December\\xa031, 2021, we had $2.4 billion of PPP loans outstanding. We voluntarily committed to donate all of the gross processing fees received from PPP loans funded in 2020.

       " Document(page_content='LIBOR Transition \\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely \\nreferenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. Additionally, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts. \\nIn preparation for the cessation of the various LIBOR \\nsettings, we have undertaken a variety of activities. Among other things, we proactively implemented internal “stop-sell” dates to discontinue offering products referencing LIBOR except pursuant to limited exceptions consistent with regulatory guidance. At the same time, we expanded our suite of product offerings that are indexed to alternative reference rates. \\nWe also continue to transition our legacy LIBOR contracts to \\nalternative reference rates. We transitioned substantially all of our legacy contracts with LIBOR settings impacted by the December 31, 2021, cessation date to alternative reference rates, and we will continue to address contracts with LIBOR settings that are impacted by the June 30, 2023, cessation date. • For USD LIBOR contracts that mature before June 30, 2023, those contracts that are renewed or replaced will be indexed to alternative reference rates. \\n• At December 31, 2021, the notional amount of our derivatives indexed to USD LIBOR, including bilateral contracts that mature after June\\xa030, 2023, and centrally-cleared contracts that mature either before or after June 30, 2023, was over $6 trillion. We expect substantially all of these contracts to transition to SOFR either prior to or immediately after June 30, 2023, in accordance with existing fallback provisions. \\n• At December 31, 2021, we had over $350 billion of USD LIBOR commercial credit facilities that mature after June 30, 2023. These contracts generally do not contain appropriate fallback provisions. We are proactively engaging with our clients and contract parties to amend these contracts to replace LIBOR with an alternative reference rate or to include appropriate fallback provisions, if necessary. \\n• At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $30 billion of USD LIBOR consumer loans and lines secured by residential real estate that mature after June 30, 2023.

Substantially all of these debt securities contain fallback provisions and are expected to transition to an alternative reference rate immediately after June 30, 2023. \\nAdditionally, we continue to monitor legislative \\ndevelopments that would provide a statutory framework to \\nreplace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. \\nFor information regarding the risks and potential impact of \\nLIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced, or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section in this Report. \\nCapital Matters \\nEffective October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, the Company’s stress capital buffer used to determine our minimum risk-based capital requirements under the Standardized Approach became 3.10%. Beginning January 1, 2022, our global \\nsystemically important bank (G-SIB) capital surcharge decreased by 50 basis points from 2.00% to 1.50%. \\nEffective January 1, 2022, we are required to use the \\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) for calculating exposure amounts for credit risk-weighted assets (RWAs) on derivative contracts. The adoption of SA-CCR resulted in an increase of less than 1.00% in total RWAs under the Standardized Approach (which was our binding approach at December 31, 2021) and a decrease of less than 0.50% in total leverage exposure at January 1, 2022. \\nOn January 25, 2022, the Board approved an increase to the \\nCompany’s first quarter 2022 common stock dividend to $0.25\\xa0per share. For additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section in this Report. \\nBusiness Divestitures \\nOn November 1, 2021, we closed our previously announced agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services business and our previously announced agreement to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM). We recorded net gains of $674 million and $269\\xa0million, respectively, from these sales, which are subject to certain post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions. \\nFinancial Performance \\nIn 2021, we generated $21.5 billion of net income and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.95, compared with $3.4\\xa0billion of net income and EPS of $0.43 in 2020. Financial performance for 2021, compared with 2020, included the following: • total revenue increased due to higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income; \\n• provision for credit losses decreased reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment, which led to lower charge-offs and better portfolio credit quality; \\n• noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating losses, restructuring charges, and professional and outside services expense, partially offset by higher incentive and revenue-related compensation in personnel expense; \\n• average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding originations in our residential mortgage loan portfolio, weak demand for commercial loans, and the reclassification of student loans (included in other consumer loans) to loans \\nheld for sale (LHFS); and', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

These \\nchanges had a nominal impact on net income and retained earnings on an annual basis and did not impact historical trends or business drivers.

       " Document(page_content='Earnings Performance \\nWells Fargo net income for 2021 was $21.5\\xa0billion ($4.95\\xa0diluted \\nEPS), compared with $3.4\\xa0billion ($0.43\\xa0diluted EPS) for 2020. Net income increased in 2021, compared with 2020, due to a $18.3\\xa0billion decrease in provision for credit losses, a $8.4\\xa0billion \\nincrease in noninterest income, and a $3.8\\xa0billion decrease in \\nnoninterest expense, partially offset by a $6.7 billion increase in \\nincome tax expense, a $4.2\\xa0billion decrease in net interest \\nincome, and a $1.4 billion increase in net income from noncontrolling interests. \\nFor a discussion of our 2020 financial results, compared with \\n2019, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2020. \\nNet Interest Income \\nNet interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. \\nNet interest income and the net interest margin in any one \\nperiod can be significantly affected by a variety of factors including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in \\n2021, compared with 2020, due to the impact of lower interest \\nrates, lower loan balances reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of our student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization, partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. Net \\ninterest income in 2021 included interest income from PPP loans of $518\\xa0million. Additionally, in 2021, we had interest income associated with loans we purchased from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization pools of $1.1\\xa0billion. For additional information about loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in this Report. \\nTable 3 presents the individual components of net interest \\nincome and the net interest margin.

       " Document(page_content='Income tax expense was $5.6 billion in 2021, compared with an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, driven by higher pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate was 20.6% for 2021, \\ncompared with (52.1)% for 2020. The effective income tax rate for 2021 reflected the impact of higher pre-tax income while the effective income tax rate for 2020 reflected both the impact of income tax benefits (including tax credits) on lower pre-tax income and income tax benefits related to the resolution and reevaluation of prior period matters with U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The income tax expense (benefit) and our effective income tax rate for both years reflected the impact of changes in accounting policy for certain tax-advantaged investments adopted in second quarter 2021. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nOperating Segment Results \\nOur management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see Table 7. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income \\nWells Fargo & Company 12', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

In March 2021, we announced an agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services business and, in second quarter 2021, we moved the business from the Commercial Banking operating segment to Corporate. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. These changes did not impact the previously reported consolidated financial results of the Company. On November 1, 2021, we closed the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and WFAM. \\nIn second quarter 2021, we elected to change our \\naccounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments and elected to change the presentation of investment tax credits related to solar energy investments. These accounting policy changes had a nominal impact on reportable operating segment results. Prior period financial statement line items for the Company, as well as for the reportable operating segments, have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Our LIHTC investments are included in the Corporate and Investment Banking operating segment and our solar energy investments are included in the Commercial Banking operating segment. For additional information, see the “Overview – Recent Developments” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment’s use of capital. \\nSelected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results. Management believes that these metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable operating segments or lines of business.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

Our off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. \\nCommitments to Lend \\nWe enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because a significant portion of these commitments are not funded. For additional information, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Entities \\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with securitization transactions and are considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. Guarantees and Other Arrangements \\nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCommitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities \\nWe enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional information, see Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nDerivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments.

       " Document(page_content='Risk Management \\nWells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly \\naffect our financial performance and our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders. \\nRisk is Part of our Business Model. Risk is the possibility of an \\nevent occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \\nto achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model risks, and strategic and reputation risks. \\nRisk Profile. The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \\naggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \\nbusiness activities after taking into consideration risk management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \\nRisk Capacity. Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \\nthe Company could assume given its current level of resources \\nbefore triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital and liquidity needs. \\nRisk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk \\ncapacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current \\nlevel of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \\nRisk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \\nCompany’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \\nCompany’s most significant opportunities and challenges, develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in the strategic planning process, which is closely linked with the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s evaluation. \\nRisk and Climate Change. The Company is committed to helping \\nmitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities \\nand to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. Risk is Managed by Everyone. Every employee, in the course of \\ntheir daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nRisk and Culture. Senior management sets the tone at the top \\nby supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions.

       " Document(page_content='by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board holds senior management \\naccountable for establishing and maintaining this culture and for effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to the Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations. \\nRisk Management Framework. The Company’s risk \\nmanagement framework sets forth the Company’s core \\nprinciples for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by \\nbuilding an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We continue to enhance our risk management programs, including our operational and compliance risk management as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s April 20, 2018, consent orders. \\nRisk Governance \\nRole of the Board. The Board oversees the Company’s business, \\nincluding its risk management. It assesses senior management’s performance and holds senior management accountable for maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management program. \\nBoard Committee Structure. The Board carries out its risk \\noversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. \\nThe Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk management framework and oversees management’s implementation of the framework, including how the Company manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the Company’s adherence to its risk appetite.

The Enterprise Risk & Control \\nCommittee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management program. \\nThe ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its \\nmembership is comprised of principal line of business and certain enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also escalates certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with the Company’s escalation management policy. \\nEach principal line of business and enterprise function has a \\nrisk and control committee, which is a management governance committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its scope limited to the respective principal line of business or enterprise function.

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased to $2.4\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $4.8\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2020, and consumer nonaccrual loans increased to $4.8 billion at December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $3.9\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2020. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.81% of total loans at December\\xa031, 2021, compared with 0.98% at December\\xa031, 2020. \\n• Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of our average commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 0.06% and 0.33%, respectively, in 2021, compared with 0.31% and 0.39%, respectively, in 2020. \\n• Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 90\\xa0days or more past due and still accruing were $235\\xa0million and $424 million in our commercial and consumer portfolios, respectively, at December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $78\\xa0million and $612 million at December\\xa031, 2020. \\n• Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(4.2)\\xa0billion in 2021, compared with $14.0\\xa0billion in 2020. \\n• The ACL for loans decreased to $13.8\\xa0billion, or 1.54% of total loans, at December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $19.7\\xa0billion, or 2.22%, at December\\xa031, 2020. \\nAdditional information on our loan portfolios and our credit \\nquality trends follows. \\nCOVID-Related Lending Accommodations During 2021, we \\nprovided customers with residential mortgage loan payment \\ndeferrals of up to 18 months in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At December\\xa031, 2021, approximately $1.1\\xa0billion of unpaid principal balance related to residential mortgage loans, excluding those insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), remained in a deferral period. \\nBased on guidance in the CARES Act and the Interagency \\nStatement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)  issued by federal banking regulators in April 2020 (the \\nInteragency Statement), both of which we elected to apply, loan modifications related to COVID-19 and that meet certain other criteria are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) classification. The TDR relief provided by the CARES Act guidance is no longer available after January 1, 2022; however, certain COVID-related lending accommodations may continue to \\nbe eligible for TDR relief under the Interagency Statement. At December\\xa031, 2021, the majority of residential mortgage loans that were in a deferral period, excluding those that were government insured/guaranteed, met the criteria for TDR relief and were therefore not classified as TDRs. \\nCustomers who were current prior to entering the deferral \\nperiod and confirmed their ability to return to their contractual loan payments upon exiting the deferral period will remain on accrual status. Customers who are unable to resume making their contractual loan payments upon exiting the deferral period are generally placed on nonaccrual status until they perform for a period of time. Such customers may require further assistance after exiting from these deferral programs and may receive or be eligible to receive modifications, or may be charged-off in accordance with our policies.

       " Document(page_content='Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews \\xa0Measuring and monitoring \\nour credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, \\ncollateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early identification of developing risk and to support our determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.

Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories. \\nWe had $13.0 billion of the commercial and industrial loans \\nand lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $19.3\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2020. The change was driven by decreases in the oil, gas and pipelines, retail, transportation services, and entertainment and recreation industries, as these industries continue to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nThe majority of our commercial and industrial loans and \\nlease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of repayment. \\nThe portfolio increased at December\\xa031, 2021, compared \\nwith December\\xa031, 2020, driven by higher loan demand resulting \\nin increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness.

Interest-only loans were approximately 3% of total loans at both December\\xa031, 2021, and December\\xa031, 2020. We believe our origination process appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our residential mortgage loans and our ACL for loans considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. \\nThe residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of \\nresidential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to 30 years.\\xa0We continuously monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan is delinquent. \\nOur residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior \\nlien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options available during the draw period of (1)\\xa0interest-only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. As of December\\xa031, 2021, lines of credit in a draw period primarily used the interest-only option. The lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL estimate. \\nDuring the draw period, the borrower has the option of \\nconverting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate \\nWells Fargo & Company 38', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30\\xa0years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. \\nIn anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit \\nborrowers reaching the end of their contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. \\nWe monitor changes in real estate values and underlying \\neconomic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of large numbers of properties in a short period of time using market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of an individual property may vary significantly from the average for the market area. We have processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when AVMs may be used.

In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. \\nIn connection with our sales and securitization of residential', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",

See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. \\nWe provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage \\nloans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms of these programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our exposure to loss related to these programs. \\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors.\\n The loans we service were originated by us or by other \\nmortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4)\\xa0maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements.

However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the securitization market. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations. \\nEach agreement under which we act as servicer or master \\nservicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. For additional information on the OCC consent order, see the “Overview” section in this Report. \\nAsset/Liability Management \\nAsset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. \\nAt the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability \\nCommittee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate.

       " Document(page_content='INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a \\nfinancial intermediary for customers based on investments such as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. We are subject to interest rate risk because: • assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; \\n• assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; \\n• short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently; \\n• the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or \\n• interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. \\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 30, \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 30: • Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities. \\n• Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant. \\n• Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. \\n• Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding products could impact expected net interest income. \\n• Deposit rates paid may change with market interest rate changes. Our interest rate sensitivity of deposits, referred to as deposit betas, is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio. The actual deposit rates paid may differ from the assumed deposit rates paid in these scenarios due to lags in repricing and other factors. \\n• We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios. \\nWells Fargo & Company 49', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

For the simulations with downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00% interest rate floor limits the amount of the decline in net interest income. We may have a larger decline in net interest income when interest rates increase for the base scenario relative to the interest rate floor. \\nThe sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest \\nincome or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite direction of our net interest income. Mortgage originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates and generally increase in response to lower interest rates, particularly refinancing activity. Mortgage banking results are also impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for additional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from \\nchanges in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, our trading assets are (before the effects of certain economic hedges) generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities. As a result, net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest rates rise and fall, respectively. The impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate exposures.

The notional or contractual amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, are presented in Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: • to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and • to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK\\xa0 We', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nWe typically originate agency residential mortgage loans as \\nheld for sale and certain prime non-agency residential mortgage loans as held for investment. Occasionally, we designate some of our agency residential mortgage loans as held for investment and non-agency residential mortgage loan originations as held for sale in support of future issuances of private label residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). We issued $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion of RMBS in 2021 and 2020, respectively. \\nInterest rate and market risk can be substantial in our \\nmortgage businesses. Changes in interest rates may impact origination and servicing fees, the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants, as well as the associated income or loss in mortgage banking noninterest income, including the gains or losses related to economic hedges of MSRs and LHFS. Given the time it takes for customer behavior to fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will generally affect our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis. The amount and timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest rates. \\nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \\nsubjective and involve complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently unpredictable. See the “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional information. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements. For additional information on mortgage banking, including key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking \\nActivities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the \\npropensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the servicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand, which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \\nresidential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest rate options.

A steep yield curve generally produces higher carry income while a flat or inverted yield curve can result in lower or potentially negative carry income. \\nThe size of the hedge and the particular combination of \\nhedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Because market factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio and the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our mortgage businesses change continually, the types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. \\nHedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage \\nbanking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged. \\nMARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and impairment of private equity investments. \\nThe Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk matters to the Risk Committee. \\nAt the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk \\nManagement function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for market risk. The Market and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into the CRO and provides periodic reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee. \\nMARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading \\nactivities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense components of our consolidated statement of income.

For additional information on the financial instruments used in our trading activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \\nestimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management function aggregates and monitors all exposures to ensure risk measures are within our established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and legal entity. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation model which assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the potential future outcomes and measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on average once every 100 trading days. \\nAverage Company Trading General VaR was $49\\xa0million for \\nthe year ended December\\xa031, 2021, compared with $123 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2020. The decrease in average Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, was driven by market volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular changes in interest rate curves and a significant widening of credit spreads exiting the 12-month historical look-back window used to calculate VaR. \\nWells Fargo & Company 51', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",

The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly \\ncorrelated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days. \\nSensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR \\nmodels, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves. \\nStress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to \\nadverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, \\nstress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These scenarios assume that the market moves happen instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). \\nAn inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \\nhistorical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis addresses how these events might affect the risk factors relevant to a portfolio. \\nThe Company’s stress testing framework is also used in \\ncalculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in this Report. \\nMARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",

The first method (method one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one.

The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). Effective January 1, 2022, we are required by federal \\nbanking regulators to use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) for calculating exposure amounts for credit RWAs on derivative contracts. SA-CCR replaced the current exposure method for calculating these exposure amounts for purposes of our risk-based capital ratios and our supplementary leverage ratio. The adoption of SA-CCR resulted in an increase of less than 1.00% in total RWAs under the Standardized Approach (which was our binding approach at December 31, 2021) and a decrease of less than 0.50% in total leverage exposure at January 1, 2022. \\nThe Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and \\ntier 1 capital, along with RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and total capital remained in accordance with transition requirements at December 31, 2021, but became fully phased-in beginning January 1, 2022. \\nThe tables that follow provide information about our risk-\\nbased capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III capital rules. Although we report certain capital amounts and ratios in accordance with transition requirements for bank regulatory reporting purposes, we manage our capital on a fully phased-in basis. For information about our capital requirements calculated in accordance with transition requirements, see Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nTable 39 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital,', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n",

Our long-term targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio that is 100 basis points above our regulatory requirement plus an incremental buffer of 25 to 50 basis points. Our capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, including changes to the regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. \\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells\\xa0Fargo.

The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Furthermore, in order to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for effective senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks. \\n• Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank \\nAct established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance. \\n• Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities . The \\nDodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally-registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, as well as others adopted or under consideration by regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 81}),\n",

For additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable to us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. \\n“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \\nRules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. In addition to the Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. On June 29, 2021, we submitted our most recent resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 82}),\n",

Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented.

In response \\nto the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal banking regulators undertook a number of measures to help stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like Wells\\xa0Fargo to continue lending to consumers and businesses. For example, in order to facilitate the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), federal banking regulators issued rules designed to encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus measures, such as the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity and the functioning of markets, including facilities covering money market mutual funds and term asset-backed securities loans. Certain of these measures, including the acceptance of applications under the Paycheck Protection Program and the extension of credit under certain FRB lending facilities, ended in 2021. Federal banking regulators also issued rules amending the regulatory capital and TLAC rules and other prudential regulations to temporarily ease certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage the use of certain FRB-established facilities in order to further promote lending to consumers and businesses. \\nWells Fargo & Company 64', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Critical Accounting Policies\\xa0\\nOur significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: • the allowance for credit losses; \\n• the valuation of residential MSRs; \\n• the fair value of financial instruments; \\n• income taxes; \\n• liability for contingent litigation losses; and \\n• goodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit \\nCommittee. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nWe maintain an ACL for loans, which is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFor loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured \\nbased on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. \\nChanges in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \\nfor credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considerations include the evaluation of past events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nJudgment is specifically applied in: \\n• Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period.

       " Document(page_content='Judgment is specifically applied in: \\n• Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to \\nestimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real estate prices. Quarterly, we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. \\n• Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term \\naverage loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n• Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. Individually \\nassessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. \\n• Usage of credit loss estimation models. We use internally \\ndeveloped models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses. Management uses a combination of judgment and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are validated in accordance with the Company’s policies by an internal model validation group. We routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against the company-wide risk inventory to help ensure that we appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed. \\n• Valuation of collateral . The current fair value of collateral is \\nutilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously written-down below current recovery value. \\n• Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual \\nterm of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension \\nWells Fargo & Company 65', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n",

Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. \\n• Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s \\njudgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nSensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key \\nassumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by management. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, and general economic conditions. General economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables, which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. \\nOur sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s \\nview of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We applied 100% weight to the downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration from a COVID-19 resurgence. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately $4.4 billion at December\\xa031, 2021. The hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. \\nThe sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities \\nand other financial assets given its size relative to the overall ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date.\\xa0\\nValuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) \\nMSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from third parties. We also have acquired MSRs in the past under co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. \\nWe carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans \\nat fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are reflected in earnings. \\nWe use a model to estimate the fair value of our \\nresidential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and require judgment to determine. If observable market indications do become available, these are factored into the estimates as appropriate: • The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future net servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \\n• The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of \\nreturn investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). \\n• The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes \\nestimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market participant's view for our estimated cost to service and our actual costs may vary from that estimate. \\nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \\nand generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and \\nmortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards, as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value estimate to independent appraisals. \\nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. \\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value \\nadjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS debt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments, such as certain LHFS, a majority of nonmarketable equity securities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments due to application of lower-of-cost-or-market \\nWells Fargo & Company 66\", metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

We also disclose our estimate of fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as loans held for investment or issuances of long-term debt. \\nThe accounting requirements for fair value measurements \\ninclude a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. \\nWhen developing fair value measurements, we maximize the \\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that generally use market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internal models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. \\nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs, \\nmanagement judgment is necessary as we make judgments about significant assumptions that market participants would use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of many factors, including market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market participant would require in light of the illiquid market. \\nWe continually assess the level and volume of market \\nactivity in our debt and equity security classes in determining adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions can change over time, our determination of which securities markets are considered active or inactive can change.

A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \\nThe\\xa0income tax laws\\xa0of the jurisdictions in which we operate \\nare complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions.\\xa0Our interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions.\\xa0We attempt to resolve these \\nWells Fargo & Company 67', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 86}),\n",

Revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any given quarter. \\nSee Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for a further description of our provision for income taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities. \\nLiability for Contingent Litigation Losses \\nThe Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities, and many of those proceedings and investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions. \\nWe apply judgment when establishing an accrual for \\npotential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding of information currently available related to the legal evaluation and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management. These matters may be in various stages of investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was not considered or was considered remote in anticipated occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. \\nThe outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject \\nto significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. \\nSee Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for additional information. \\nGoodwill Impairment \\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in market capitalization. \\nWe identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill \\nimpairment at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using both an income approach and a market approach and are intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as well as external market conditions. The methodologies for calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are periodically assessed by senior management and revised as necessary. \\nThe income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) \\nanalysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our lines of business. Significant assumptions include future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and assumptions related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, we incorporate a terminal value estimate based on an assumed long-term growth rate. We discount these forecasted cash flows using a rate derived from the capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity specific to that reporting unit, which reflects risks and uncertainties in the financial markets and in our internally generated business projections. \\nThe market approach utilizes observable market data from \\ncomparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in the selection of comparable companies and includes those with the most similar business activities. \\nThe aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our \\nmarket capitalization for our fourth quarter 2021 assessment. Factors that we considered in our assessment and contributed to this difference included: (i) an overall premium that would be paid to gain control of the operating and financial decisions of the Company, (ii) synergies that we believe may not be reflected in the price of the Company’s common stock, (iii) a higher degree of complexity and execution risk at the Company level, compared with the individual reporting unit level, and (iv) risks or benefits at the Company level that may not be reflected in the fair value of the individual reporting units. \\nBased on our fourth quarter 2021 assessment, there was no \\nimpairment of goodwill at December 31, 2021.

The Update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholder's life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair value. The cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value upon adoption of the Update, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the earliest period presented and will affect our regulatory capital calculations. At December\\xa031, 2021, our estimated liability related to these guaranteed minimum benefits was approximately $500 million and was associated with approximately $13.1\\xa0billion of policyholder account values. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions. We plan to economically hedge the market volatility, where feasible. Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs are not expected to be material. \\nOther Accounting Developments \\nThe following Updates are applicable to us but are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements: • ASU 2020-06 – Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity \\n• ASU 2021-05 – Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases \\nwith Variable Lease Payments \\n• ASU 2021-08 – Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers \\n• ASU 2021-10 – Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance \\nWells Fargo & Company 69\", metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

These businesses have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest or disturbances, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the U.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or any other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S. or global economy ,\\xa0could materially adversely \\naffect our financial\\xa0results and condition.\\xa0\\nA weakening in business or economic conditions, including \\nhigher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, which can negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment levels worsen\\xa0or if home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit products, including our mortgages, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n",

We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged low interest rate environment as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. \\nChanges in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread \\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates – could also reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve flattens, or even inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the FRB. \\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \\nour earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based on changes in interest rates. \\nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \\nis always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions, as', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n",

If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff.

It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. \\nFuture allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \\nvariety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December\\xa031, 2021, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nCredit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. \\nWe may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the \\nextent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our \\nloans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or geography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in such industries to meet their financial obligations. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater \\nWells Fargo & Company 78', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 97}),\n",

As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet.

As a large financial institution that serves customers through numerous physical\\xa0locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking and other distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide products and services to our customers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, and as cyber and other information security attacks have become more prevalent and complex, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there have been and could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information security breaches. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover critical business processes or operations that have been disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our customers. \\nAs a result of financial institutions and technology systems', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 98}),\n",

Information security risks for large financial \\ninstitutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, software, networks, and our customers’ devices are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks or other information security breaches, which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures and inappropriately circumvents controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. \\nDue to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of \\nfinancial institutions and technology systems, an information security incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole.

For example, Wells\\xa0Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as their third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity and other information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses associated with an information security breach. \\nCyber attacks or other information security breaches \\naffecting us or third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nOur framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in \\nmitigating risk and loss to us.

Our risk management framework is also dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the inability to align performance management and compensation to achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed to risks if we do not accurately or completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise, or if an employee fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other misconduct. In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and predict risks, such as market, interest rate and credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and \\nassess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could result in ineffective risk management practices, business decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our business decisions and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or accurately predict future events or exposures. Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, build and maintain robust risk management policies and practices.\\xa0If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nWe may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory \\nproceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to retail sales practices and other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm.

Various government entities \\nand offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016, and various non-governmental parties filed lawsuits against us seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. The Company has entered into various settlements to resolve these investigations and proceedings, as a result of which we have incurred monetary penalties, costs, and business restrictions. If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. \\nWells Fargo and other financial institutions have been \\ntargeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, which have included disrupting the operation of our retail banking locations, and have been subject to negative public commentary, including with respect to the fees charged for various products and services.

Climate change related impacts could also negatively affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions regarding climate change, could also require us to change certain of our business and/or risk management practices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if we are unable to achieve our objectives or if our response is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient.

We are one of the largest mortgage originators \\nand residential mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus the fair value of our MSRs. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Changes in interest rates can also negatively affect the fair value of certain residential mortgage loans within LHFS and other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations. For example, similar to other interest-bearing securities, if market interest rates increase relative to the yield on these residential mortgage LHFS and other interests, their fair value may fall. \\nWhen rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually \\ntends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates. \\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \\nour mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. \\nWe rely on the GSEs to guarantee or purchase mortgage \\nloans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy requirements. In order to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs or government insuring agency standards, which are referred to as “nonconforming” loans. We generally retain these \\nWells Fargo & Company 83', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 102}),\n",

When we retain a \\nloan on our balance sheet not only do we keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could be used to generate new loans. If we were unable or unwilling to retain nonconforming loans on our balance sheet, whether due to regulatory, business or other reasons, our ability to originate new nonconforming loans may be reduced, thereby reducing the interest income we could earn from these loans. Similarly, if the GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate new mortgage loans, could also be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” sections in this Report. \\nWe may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse \\nconsequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to the residential mortgage loans we originate or service.  In \\norder to reduce credit risk and obtain additional funding, from time to time we may securitize or sell mortgage loans that we originate. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements under which we sell mortgage loans that we originate or in the insurance or guaranty agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that reflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant additions to the repurchase liability. \\nAdditionally, for residential mortgage loans that we \\noriginate, we could become subject to monetary damages and other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or regulations. \\nFurthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for \\nthe mortgage loans we service, we may face a number of consequences, including termination as servicer or master servicer, requirements to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us to perform our servicing obligations, and/or contractual obligations to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing income.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 103}),\n",

In addition, we may continue to be subject to fines, business restrictions, and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our servicing of flood zone properties.

We compete with other \\nfinancial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customer relationships and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. \\nContinued technological advances and the growth of \\ne-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other \\nWells Fargo & Company 84', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 103}),\n",

To the extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new products and services or responding or adapting to the competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we may lose customer relationships and our revenue growth and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical \\nto the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is \\nheavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, capital markets, risk management and technology, the competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, effectively manage employee performance and development, and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same compensation limitations. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, including successors for senior leadership positions, our business performance, competitive position and future prospects may be adversely affected. \\nFINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS \\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards, and \\nchanges in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.  Our accounting policies are fundamental \\nto determining and understanding our financial results and condition. As described below, some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies could materially affect our financial statements. \\nFrom time to time the FASB and the SEC change the \\nfinancial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, also retroactively, in each case potentially resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. For additional information, see the “Current Accounting \\nDevelopments” section in this Report. \\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Developments” section in this Report. \\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and \\nestimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future, and our financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting.\\xa0 Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are \\nrequired to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For a description of these policies, see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. \\nCertain of our financial instruments, including derivative \\nassets and liabilities, debt securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment, and there is no assurance that our models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant inputs required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings. \\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires \\nour management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. In addition, our customers may rely on the effectiveness of our internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be “independent” of us under SEC rules, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences. \\n*\\xa0 *\\xa0 * \\nWells Fargo & Company 85', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",

We provide banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50\\xa0states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells\\xa0Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the financial services industry. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including: • allowance for credit losses (Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses)); \\n• valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities)); \\n• valuations of financial instruments (Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)); \\n• liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 15 (Legal Actions)); \\n• income taxes; and \\n• goodwill impairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. Change in Accounting Policies \\nIn second quarter 2021, we elected to change our accounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the investments are carried at amortized cost and amortized in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized in income tax expense. Previously, we recognized the amortization of the investments in other noninterest income and the related tax impacts were recognized in income tax expense. We determined that the proportional amortization method is preferable because it better aligns the financial statement presentation with the economic impact of these investments, which generate tax credits over the lives of the investments. Adoption of the proportional amortization method was applied retrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by $448\\xa0million as of January 1, 2019. \\nIn second quarter 2021, we also elected to change the', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In second quarter 2021, we also elected to change the \\npresentation of investment tax credits related to solar energy investments, which are accounted for under the deferral method. We reclassified the investment tax credits on our consolidated balance sheet from accrued expenses and other liabilities to a reduction of the carrying value of the investment balances. We also reclassified the investment tax credits, which are recognized over time, from income tax expense to interest income for solar energy leases or noninterest income for solar energy equity investments. We determined that this presentation is preferable because it better reflects the financial statement presentation of the investment tax credits as an integral component of the investments. The change in accounting policy was adopted retrospectively to January 1, 2019. \\nTable 1.1 presents the impact of the accounting policy \\nchanges for LIHTC investments and solar energy investments to our consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheet.

The Update also clarifies other aspects of the relief provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 848.

We consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary, which is when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

In addition, debt securities that are held for investment purposes that we have elected to account for under the fair value method, are classified as trading. \\nOur trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net gains on trading and securities within noninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in net interest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading activities include our \\nactions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments and market-making activities. We also take positions to manage our exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold financial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short positions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the purchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the anticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an offsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure to the customer transaction. We earn income based on the transaction price difference between the customer transaction and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded. \\nOur market-making activities include taking long and short \\ntrading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These activities are typically executed on a short-term basis. As a market-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference between the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the positions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading positions held on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we may enter into separate derivative or security positions to manage our exposure related to our long and short trading positions taken in our market-making activities. Income earned on these market-making activities are reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded. \\nDebt Securities \\nOur investments in debt securities that are not held for trading purposes are classified as either debt securities available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity (HTM). \\nInvestments in debt securities for which the Company does \\nnot have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as AFS. AFS debt securities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in cumulative other comprehensive income (OCI). The amount reported in OCI is net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and applicable income taxes.

       " Document(page_content='INTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION Unamortized \\npremiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the effective interest method, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the next call date using the effective interest method. As principal repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. \\nWe recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \\nsecurities in net gains on trading and securities within noninterest income using the specific identification method. \\nIMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt \\nsecurities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of debt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations for certain types of AFS debt securities include: • Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, including federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government. \\n• Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are most impacted by changes in the relationship between municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. \\n• Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also impacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets underlying the security. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we \\nhave the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized in net gains on trading and securities within noninterest income equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis, net of ACL, and the fair value of the AFS debt security. Following the recognition of this impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost basis is fair value. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in earnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the extent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies relating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt securities classified as HTM. \\nTRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES  Upon \\ntransfer of a debt security from the AFS to HTM classification, the amortized cost is reset to fair value adjusted for any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model. Unrealized gains or losses at the transfer date continue to be reported in cumulative OCI. The cumulative OCI balance is amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized premiums and discounts using the effective interest method. Any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model is reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re-established. The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are recorded in provision for credit losses. \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES We \\ngenerally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors similar to those described for loans.

We monitor the fair value of securities purchased and sold as well as the collateral pledged and received. Additional collateral is pledged or returned to maintain the appropriate collateral position for the transactions. These financing transactions do not create material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring process. We include securities sold under repurchase agreements in short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. At December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, short-term borrowings were primarily comprised of securities sold under repurchase agreements. \\nLoans Held for Sale \\nLoans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes commercial and residential mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. We have elected the fair value option for a majority of residential LHFS (see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)). The remaining residential LHFS are held at the lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) and are measured on a pool level basis. \\nCommercial LHFS are generally held at LOCOM and are \\nmeasured on an individual loan basis. We have elected the fair value option for certain commercial loans included in LHFS that are used in market-making activities for our trading business. \\nGains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage \\nLHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest income. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net gains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are recognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are recognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. Interest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income. \\nWhen a determination is made at the time of commitment \\nto originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic review under our management evaluation processes, including corporate asset/liability management.

When management makes this determination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS portfolio at LOCOM.

When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to the modification).

These modified terms may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, if applicable. For modifications where we forgive principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. If the underwriting for a TDR modification did not include an evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay, the loan is deemed collateral dependent. Other than resolutions such as foreclosures, sales and transfers to held-for-sale, we may remove loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan. \\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS AND OTHER RELIEF RELATED \\nTO COVID-19  The  Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) and the  Interagency Statement on Loan \\nModifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with \\nCustomers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)  issued by federal \\nregulators in April 2020 (the Interagency Statement) provide optional, temporary relief from accounting for certain loan modifications as TDRs.

The TDR relief provided by the CARES Act guidance is no longer available after January 1, 2022; however, certain COVID-related lending accommodations may continue to be eligible for TDR relief under the Interagency Statement. \\nFor COVID-related modifications in the form of payment \\ndeferrals or payment forbearance, delinquency status will not advance and loans that were accruing at the time the relief is provided will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status during the deferral period. Interest accrued during payment deferrals or payment forbearance may be included in the principal balance of the loans and charge-offs will generally be based on delinquency status after the loan exits the deferral or forbearance period. \\nFORECLOSED ASSETS  Foreclosed\\xa0assets obtained through our \\nlending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans have been written down to their net realizable value prior to foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is recorded with a charge to the ACL at foreclosure. We allow up to 90 days after foreclosure to finalize determination of net realizable value. Thereafter, changes in net realizable value are recorded to noninterest expense. The net realizable value of these assets is reviewed and updated periodically depending on the type of property. Certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure are included in accounts receivable, not foreclosed assets. These receivables were loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are measured based on the balance expected to be recovered from the FHA or VA. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nThe ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for AFS and HTM debt securities, other financing receivables measured at amortized cost, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. While we attribute portions of the allowance to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios), loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer) or major security type, the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nOur ACL process involves procedures to appropriately \\nconsider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset classes, portfolio segments, and major security types. For each loan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt security type, losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities with similar risk characteristics. For loans and securities that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, the losses are estimated individually, which generally includes our \\nWells Fargo & Company 100', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

This period reflects management’s expectation of losses based on forward-looking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by management to estimate future credit losses. \\n• Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast period. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n• The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension options. We also incorporate any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a TDR. Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. \\n• Utilization of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to measure credit impairment for loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring, unless they are collateral dependent and measured at the fair value of the collateral. The DCF methods obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the initial and historical mean loss forecast periods described above. \\n• For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the ACL, which incorporate expected credit losses using the conceptual components described above. For most HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss model, similar to the methodology used for loans. \\nThe ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \\nvaluation account that is deducted from, or added to, the', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

When credit expectations change, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported in provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off are subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a negative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was previously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot have an associated negative allowance. \\nFor certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \\nloans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. Treasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not recognized an ACL as our expectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis, based on historical losses, adjusted for current and forecasted conditions, is zero. \\nA financial asset is collateral-dependent when the borrower \\nis experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. When a collateral-dependent financial asset is probable of foreclosure, we will measure the ACL based on the fair value of the collateral. If we intend to sell the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the collateral’s net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell). In most situations, based on our charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial real estate or other business assets. \\nWe do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest \\nreceivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we include an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are neither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan is 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans. \\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  \\nGenerally, commercial loans, which include net investments in lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic reviews.

Unfunded credit commitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to derive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated probability of default and loss severity at the time of default are applied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments. \\nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  For \\nconsumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer portfolio. \\nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for \\nqualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES  Our off-balance sheet \\ncredit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally in the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated \\nfor expected credit losses. These other financial assets include accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts receivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss expectation (for example, government guarantee) or no historical credit losses. Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Given the nature of these financial assets, provision for credit losses is not recognized separately from the regular income or expense associated with these financial assets. \\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are generally \\nover-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short-term in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these financial assets. \\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \\nFinancial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \\nLeasing Activity \\nAS LESSOR  We lease equipment to our customers under \\nfinancing or operating leases. Financing leases are presented in loans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-party investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual lease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The residual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales price for the equipment at lease termination based on sales history adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. Many of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at prevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at lease termination. \\nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers \\nboth the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as the estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically purchase residual value insurance on our financing leases so that our risk of loss at lease termination will be less than 10% of the initial value of the lease. In addition, we have several channels for re-leasing or marketing those assets. \\nIn connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",

On a periodic basis, operating lease assets are reviewed for impairment and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of operating lease assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. The carrying amount of leased assets is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon the eventual disposition of the equipment.

Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets are recognized when we enter into operating or financing leases and represent our obligations and rights to use these assets over the period of the leases and may be re-measured for certain modifications, resolution of certain contingencies involving variable consideration, or our exercise of options (renewal, extension, or termination) under the lease. \\nOperating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance \\nfixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, adjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered probable of exercise when measured. The lease payments are discounted using a rate determined when the lease is recognized. As we typically do not know the discount rate implicit in the lease, we estimate a discount rate that we believe approximates a collateralized borrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease. The discount rate is updated when re-measurement events occur. The related operating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease liabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. \\nWe present operating lease liabilities in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities and the related operating lease ROU assets in other assets.

Beneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and subordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain beneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to time, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new securitization transaction. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for additional information about our involvement with SPEs. \\nThe assets and liabilities transferred to a SPE are excluded \\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies as a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. \\nFor transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we \\nrecognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained (including beneficial interests or mortgage servicing rights) and all liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest income for the difference between assets obtained (net of liabilities incurred) and the carrying amount of the assets sold. Beneficial interests obtained from, and liabilities incurred in, securitizations with off-balance sheet entities may include debt and equity securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and liabilities, other assets, and other obligations such as liabilities for mortgage repurchase losses or long-term debt and are accounted for as described within this Note. \\nMortgage Servicing Rights \\nWe recognize MSRs resulting from a sale or securitization of loans that we originate (asset transfers) or through a direct purchase of such rights. We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. Commercial MSRs are subsequently measured at LOCOM. The valuation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities). \\nFor MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are \\nreported in mortgage banking noninterest income in the period in which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at LOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is reported in mortgage banking noninterest income, analyzed monthly and adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment rates, as well as other factors. \\nMSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated \\nfor impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we stratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by individual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. \\nWells Fargo & Company 103', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) \\nPremises and Equipment \\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and amortization. We use the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the estimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for leasehold improvements. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill is recorded for business combinations when the purchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net assets, including identifiable intangible assets. \\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level \\non an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. We have determined that our reporting units are at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We identify the reporting units based on how the segments and reporting units are managed, taking into consideration the economic characteristics, nature of the products and services, and customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a significant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion of goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested business. \\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \\nof goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge to other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited. \\nWe amortize customer relationship intangible assets on an \\naccelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset. Impairment is permanently recognized by writing down the asset to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities \\nDERIVATIVES  We recognize all derivatives on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet at fair value. On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we categorize the derivative as either an accounting hedge, economic hedge or part of our customer accommodation trading and other portfolio. \\nAccounting hedges are either fair value or cash flow hedges. \\nFair value hedges represent the hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, including hedges of foreign currency exposure. Cash flow hedges represent the hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received related to a recognized asset or liability. \\nEconomic hedges and customer accommodation trading and', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 123}),\n",

Economic hedges are derivatives we use to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks associated with our non-trading activities. Customer accommodation trading and other derivatives primarily represents derivatives related to our trading business activities. We report changes in the fair values of these derivatives in noninterest income. \\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a portion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the amortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes in fair value related to the hedged risk with the offset recorded in earnings. We present derivative gains or losses in the same income statement category as the hedged asset or liability, as follows: • For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amounts are reflected in net interest income; \\n• For hedges of foreign currency risk, amounts representing the fair value changes less the accrual for periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in noninterest income. The periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest income; \\n• For hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, amounts representing the fair value change less the accrual for periodic cash flow settlements is attributed to both net interest income and noninterest income. The periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest income. \\nThe entire derivative gain or loss is included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge \\nrelationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency denominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities hedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of these swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net interest income and the difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings is recorded in OCI. \\nCASH FLOW HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses from these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same income statement category as the hedged item.

We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item using the regression analysis method. \\nDISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge \\naccounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue the designation of a derivative as a hedge, or (4) in a cash flow hedge, a derivative is de-designated because it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur. \\nWhen we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no \\nlonger adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. The remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, these amounts are amortized into net interest income over the remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the accumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately reclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in noninterest income. \\nWhen we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is \\nprobable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is reclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued and it is probable the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported in OCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to noninterest income.

       " Document(page_content='EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  We may purchase or originate financial \\ninstruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception of the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate it from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative at fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at fair value with changes recorded in noninterest income and reported within our consolidated balance sheet as a derivative asset or liability. The accounting for the remaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities of a similar type and reported within our consolidated balance sheet based upon the accounting classification of the instrument. \\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING  By using derivatives, \\nwe are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the applicable requirements, including determining the legal enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments (CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives. \\nCash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate \\nderivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to separate non-derivative receivables or payables. This cash collateral, also referred to as variation margin, is exchanged based upon derivative fair value changes, typically on a one-day lag.

The full yield curve approach aligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected benefit payment cash flows. This change does not affect the measurement of our pension obligation as the change in interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain (loss). We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate to our pension expense. Previously, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate. We made this change to improve the correlation between the yield curve and the projected benefit payment cash flows. \\nOur determination of the reasonableness of our expected \\nlong-term rate of return on plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected returns under two sets of conditions: (1) projected returns using several forward-looking capital market assumptions, and (2) historical returns for the main asset classes, which allows us to capture multiple economic cycles. We place greater emphasis on the forward-looking return and risk assumptions than on historical results. We use the resulting projections to derive a baseline expected rate of return and risk level for the Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \\npublished by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our specific experience. \\nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \\nliabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting actuarial gain or loss in OCI.

Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize.\\xa0An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement.\\xa0Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods.

Awards to employees who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who become retirement eligible before the final vesting date are expensed between the grant date and the date the employee becomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment ends. \\nPSAs and certain RSRs granted in 2019 and 2020 included \\ndiscretionary conditions that can result in forfeiture and are measured at fair value initially and subsequently until the discretionary conditions end. For these awards, the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in our stock price. Awards granted in 2021 no longer included these discretionary conditions and are not adjusted for subsequent changes in stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also fluctuates based on the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions.\\xa0The total expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized upon the completion of the performance period (the determination of which awards will vest is a combination of performance conditions and discretion). \\nEarnings Per Common Share \\nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. \\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \\nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \\nare required to record them at fair value, when we have elected the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to fair value only as required through the application of an accounting method such as LOCOM, the measurement alternative, or write-downs of individual assets. We classify our assets and liabilities measured at fair value \\nbased upon a three-level hierarchy that assigns the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels are as follows: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. \\n• Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions that are not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of discounted cash flow models, market comparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar techniques. \\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to \\nassess the appropriate classification of financial instruments \\nwithin the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in availability of observable market data, which also may result in changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. \\nSee Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for a more \\ndetailed discussion of the valuation methodologies that we apply to our assets and liabilities. \\nWells Fargo & Company 107', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

We determine the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated by NRSROs at December\\xa031, 2021, and December\\xa031, 2020. \\nTable 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

We generally require a fee to extend such commitments. Certain commitments are subject to loan agreements with covenants regarding the financial performance of the customer or borrowing base formulas on an ongoing basis that must be met before we are required to fund the commitment. We may reduce or cancel consumer commitments, including home equity lines and credit card lines, in accordance with the contracts and applicable law. For unconditionally cancelable commitments at our discretion, we do not recognize an ACL. \\nWe may, as a representative for other lenders, advance \\nfunds or provide for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in less than a week and would normally require default of both the customer and another lender to expose us to loss. The unfunded amount of these temporary advance arrangements totaled approximately $90.2 billion at December\\xa031, 2021. \\nWe issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in \\npurchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At December\\xa031, 2021, and December\\xa031, 2020, we had $1.5\\xa0billion and $1.3\\xa0billion, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial letters of credit. We also originate multipurpose lending commitments under which borrowers have the option to draw on the facility for different purposes in one of several forms, including a standby letter of credit. See Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information on standby letters of credit. \\nWhen we enter into commitments, we are exposed to credit \\nrisk. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because a significant portion of these commitments are not funded. We manage the potential risk in commitments to lend by limiting the total amount of commitments, both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these commitments and by applying the same credit standards for these commitments as for all of our credit activities. For loans and commitments to lend, we generally require \\ncollateral or a guarantee. We may require various types of collateral, including commercial and consumer real estate, autos, other short-term liquid assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Collateral requirements for each loan or commitment may vary based on the loan product and our assessment of a customer’s credit risk according to the specific credit underwriting, including credit terms and structure. \\nThe contractual amount of our unfunded credit \\ncommitments, including unissued standby and commercial letters of credit, is summarized by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable in Table 4.4.

We do not consider loan resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR.

For additional information on the TDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report. \\nWe may require some consumer borrowers experiencing \\nfinancial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned permanent modification, to determine if they can perform according to those terms.

While loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not considered modified and they continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. \\nCommitments to lend additional funds on loans whose \\nterms have been modified in a TDR amounted to $431 million and $489\\xa0million at December\\xa031, 2021, and December\\xa031, 2020, respectively. \\nTable 4.14 summarizes our TDR modifications for the \\nperiods presented by primary modification type and includes the financial effects of these modifications. For those loans that modify more than once, the table reflects each modification that occurred during the period.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans transferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which may include: • underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently making markets in those securities; \\n• providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \\n• entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \\n• holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \\n• acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n• providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \\n• providing seller financing to VIEs. \\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity \\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan sale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell originated and purchased residential \\nand commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs).

We also transfer mortgage loans into securitizations pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In exchange for the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. During the years ended December\\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased loans of $4.6 billion, $30.3 billion, and $6.3 billion, respectively, which predominantly represented repurchases of government insured loans. We recorded assets and related liabilities of $107\\xa0million and $176 million at December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, respectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. \\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual representations and warranties, as well as other recourse arrangements. At December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, our liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was $173\\xa0million and $221\\xa0million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $13.3 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. \\nOff-balance sheet mortgage loans sold or securitized \\npresented in Table 8.3 are predominantly loans securitized by the GSEs and GNMA. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees. Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers as sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer and the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. \\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell whole loans to \\nVIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs. \\nTable 8.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe period for which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred assets.

See Note 16 (Derivatives) for additional information regarding written derivative contracts. \\nLOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE  In certain sales and \\nsecuritizations of loans, including mortgage loans, we provide recourse to the buyer whereby we are required to indemnify the buyer for any loss on the loan up to par value plus accrued interest. We provide recourse, predominantly to GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. Substantially all of these programs and arrangements require that we share in the loans’ credit exposure for their remaining life by providing recourse to the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata basis in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs and arrangements, if certain events occur within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss reported in Table 13.1 represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral. We also provide representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these guarantees is separately considered and provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and warranties. \\nEXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES  We are members \\nof several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we use to clear our trades and those of our customers. It is common that all members in these organizations are required to collectively guarantee the performance of other members and of the organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these organizations. Some membership rules require members to assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another member’s default or from non-member default losses after applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 13.1 because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote.

We are required to pay the counterparties to these agreements if third parties default on certain obligations. \\nUnder certain factoring arrangements, we may be required \\nto purchase trade receivables from third parties, if receivable debtors default on their payment obligations. \\nWe use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle \\ntransactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage customers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that could occur for non-performance by our customers on transactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions subject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations related to the settlement of margin accounts and short positions, such as written call options and securities borrowing transactions. \\nWe enter into other types of indemnification agreements in \\nthe ordinary course of business under which we agree to indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us. These relationships or transactions include those arising from service as a director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements relating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various other business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to determine our potential future liability under these agreements. We do, however, record a liability for residential mortgage loans that we expect to repurchase pursuant to various representations and warranties. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the cardholder. If we are unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in connection with our merchant processing services because most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring cash or other collateral. In 2021, we processed card network transaction \\nvolume of $1.7 trillion as a merchant acquiring bank, and related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were immaterial. \\nWells Fargo & Company 148', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n",

These obligations are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \\nThe Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the \\npayment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion at December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that subsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the Parent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. For additional information regarding other restrictions on the Parent’s ability to receive dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries, see Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions).

These activities are conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We account for these transactions as collateralized financings in which we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral.

The consent orders require remediation to customers and the payment of a total of $1.0 billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their behalf. Multiple putative class actions alleging, among other things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI policies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into one multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district litigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class action against the Company and its executive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to two alleged misstatements. In addition, the Company is subject to a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that customers are entitled to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender. In November 2021, the court granted final approval of an agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay $45\\xa0million and make certain changes to its GAP refund practices in order to settle the action. Allegations related to the CPI and GAP programs were among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which has been dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues related to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer auto loans, including related insurance products. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state attorneys general. \\nCOMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION In October and \\nNovember 2020, plaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud class actions, which were consolidated into one lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former officers made false and misleading statements or omissions regarding, among other things, the Company’s commercial lending underwriting practices, the credit quality of its commercial credit portfolios, and the value of its commercial loans, collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. \\nCOMPANY 401(K) PLAN REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS Federal \\ngovernment agencies, including the United States Department of Labor, are reviewing certain transactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. \\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION  Wells Fargo', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 172}),\n",

Visa, MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages, as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July\\xa013, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately $6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants.\\xa0Other merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing several individual actions.

The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3\\xa0billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately $94.5\\xa0million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled while others remain pending. \\nMORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS  Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmortgage borrowers have filed separate putative class actions, Hernandez v.

       " Document(page_content='v. Wells Fargo , Liguori v. Wells\\xa0Fargo , and Dore v. Wells Fargo , \\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the United States District Court for the District of Washington, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, respectively. Plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys’ fees that were included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. In March 2020, the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company paid $18.5 million to resolve the claims of the initial certified class in the Hernandez \\ncase, which was approved by the district court in October 2020. The Hernandez  settlement was subsequently reopened to include \\nadditional borrowers who the Company determined should have been included in the settlement class because the Company identified a population of additional borrowers during the relevant class period whose loans had not previously been reviewed for inclusion in the original population of impacted customers. In June 2021, the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay an additional approximately $22 million to resolve the Hernandez  case, which \\nwas approved by the district court in January 2022. In July\\xa02021, the Company entered into an agreement in the Ryder  case \\npursuant to which the Company will pay $12 million to cover other impacted borrowers who were not included in the Hernandez  case, which was approved by the district court in \\nJanuary 2022. The Dore, Coordes, and Liguori cases have been \\nvoluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding these and other mortgage servicing matters. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business and insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order. In addition, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. \\nWells Fargo & Company 154', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION  In August \\n2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura) \\nand Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells\\xa0Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of their representation and warranty breaches. \\nOFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION  The Company has self-identified \\nan issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells\\xa0Fargo software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related financing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is cooperating with an inquiry from the United States Department of Justice (Department of Justice). \\nRETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS Federal and state government \\nagencies, including the Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. On February\\xa021, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of Justice’s criminal investigation into the Company’s retail sales practices, as well as a separate agreement to resolve the Department of Justice’s civil investigation. As part of the Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will be filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all the terms of the agreement. The Department of Justice criminal settlement also includes the Company’s agreement that the facts set forth in the settlement document constitute sufficient facts for the finding of criminal violations of statutes regarding bank records and personal information. On February\\xa021, 2020, the Company also entered into an order to resolve the SEC’s investigation arising out of the Company’s retail sales practices. The SEC order contains a finding, to which the Company consented, that the facts set forth include violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. As part of the resolution of the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, the Company made payments totaling $3.0 billion. The Company has also entered into agreements to resolve other government agency investigations, including investigations by the state attorneys general. In addition, a number of lawsuits were filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into various settlements to resolve these lawsuits. RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION  In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Limited and certain related entities and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) filed complaints in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging claims against the Company in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. The Company previously settled two class actions with similar allegations that were filed in November 2014 and December 2016 by institutional investors in the Southern District of New York and New York state court, respectively. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed complaints that were consolidated in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation. In March 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve the case filed by the NCUA. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION  The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells\\xa0Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. In December 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds that the Tribe is a necessary party and that the individual beneficiaries lack standing to bring claims. The motion was denied in June 2018. The case is pending trial. \\nOUTLOOK  As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible potential losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $2.9 billion as of December\\xa031, 2021. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 155', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Note 16: Derivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading or other purposes. \\nRisk Management Derivatives \\nOur asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and earnings. In a fair value or economic hedge, the effect of change in fair value will generally be offset by the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income. Customer Accommodation Trading \\nWe also use various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, as an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve engaging in market-making activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security transactions. These customer accommodations and any offsetting derivatives are treated as customer accommodation trading and other derivatives in our disclosures. Additionally, embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contracts are included in the customer accommodation trading and other derivatives disclosures, as applicable. \\nWe mention derivative instruments within several other \\nNotes in this Report.

For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income. See Note 25 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans, and paid on certain floating-rate debt due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate.

The types of derivatives used include swaps, swaptions, constant maturity mortgages, forwards, Eurodollar and Treasury futures and options contracts. Loan commitments for mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered derivatives. Residential MSRs, derivative loan commitments, certain residential mortgage LHFS, and our economic hedge derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in mortgage banking noninterest income. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information on this economic hedging activity and mortgage banking income. Customer Accommodation Trading and Other For customer accommodation trading purposes, we use swaps, futures, forwards, spots and options to assist our customers in managing their own risks, including interest rate, commodity, equity, foreign exchange, and credit contracts. These derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter into derivatives for risk management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading and other derivatives also \\ninclude embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contract. We periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and CDs where the performance of the hybrid instrument note is linked to an equity, commodity or currency index, or basket of such indices. These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the note in a manner similar to a derivative instrument and therefore are considered to contain an “embedded” derivative instrument. The indices on which the performance of the hybrid instrument is calculated are not clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The “embedded” derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative. Additionally, we may invest in hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives, such as credit derivatives, that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract. In such instances, we either elect fair value option for the hybrid instrument or separate the embedded derivative from the host contract and account for the host contract and derivative separately. \\nWells Fargo & Company 161', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 180}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Credit Derivatives \\nCredit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is \\nderived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to another party (the seller of credit protection). We use credit derivatives to assist customers with their risk management objectives predominantly by purchasing and selling credit protection on corporate debt obligations through the use of credit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help manage counterparty exposure. We would be required to perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest payment. \\nTable 16.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives. \\nTable 16.7: Sold Credit Derivatives \\nNotional amount \\n(in millions) Protection sold Protection sold – \\nnon-investment \\ngrade \\nDecember 31, 2021 \\nCredit default swaps \\nRisk participation swaps \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 8,033 6,756 \\n14,789 1,982 6,012 \\n7,994 \\nDecember 31, 2020 (1) \\nCredit default swaps Risk participation swaps \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 5,707 6,378 \\n12,085 1,805 6,262 \\n8,067 \\n(1) Prior period balances have been conformed to current period presentation. \\nProtection sold represents the estimated maximum \\nexposure to loss that would be incurred, if upon an event of \\ndefault, the value of our interests and any associated collateral declined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of recovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from collateral held or any economic hedges. \\nThe amounts under non-investment grade represent the \\nnotional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets \\nunder the credit derivative have an external rating that is investment grade. If an external rating was not available, we classified the credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit derivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order to achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk management is designed to provide an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold credit derivatives. \\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features \\nCertain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand additional collateral or require termination or replacement of derivative instruments in a net liability position.

       " Document(page_content='Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities \\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments \\nto certain assets and liabilities and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 17.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 17.4 in this Note. We provide in Table 17.8 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities carried at amortized cost. \\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed description of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \\nAssets \\nTRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded \\nat fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using internal trader prices that are subject to price verification procedures, which includes comparing against multiple independent pricing sources, including prices obtained from third-party pricing services. These services compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine if observable market information is being used versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an internal trader price, compared with pricing service prices, considerations include the range and quality of pricing service prices in addition to observable trade data. Pricing service prices are used to ensure the reasonableness of a trader price; however, valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. If a trader asserts that a third-party pricing service price is not reflective of fair value, justification for using the trader price, including recent sales activity where possible, must be provided to and approved by the appropriate levels of management. Substantially all of our trading debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. \\nAVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. \\nWhen vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \\nadjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal models use discounted cash flow techniques or market comparable pricing techniques. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS generally includes \\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. A majority of residential LHFS and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading business is based on pending transactions when available. Where market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \\nLOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that are based on the observable market price of the loan or current appraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs)  Residential MSRs are \\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are carried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that estimates the present value of expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of prepayment rates (including housing price volatility for residential MSRs), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. \\nWells Fargo & Company 164', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='DERIVATIVES  Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis. The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives, which \\ninclude certain equity option contracts, are primarily measured using available quoted market prices. The fair value of non-exchange-traded derivatives, which predominantly relate to derivatives traded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, are measured using internal valuation techniques, as quoted market prices are not always readily available. Valuation techniques and inputs to internal models depend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is based. Key inputs can include yield curves, credit curves, foreign exchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements and correlation of certain of these inputs. \\nEQUITY SECURITIES  Marketable equity securities and certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account for at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for using the equity method, cost method or measurement alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar securities of the same issuer. \\nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value for such securities. We use all available information in making this determination, which includes observable transaction prices for the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, we make adjustments\\xa0to observed market data to reflect the comparative differences between the market data and the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public companies and other investment-specific considerations like liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the instruments. \\nOTHER ASSETS Although other assets are generally recorded at \\namortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease ROU assets and foreclosed assets. Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a discounted cash flow model. \\nLiabilities \\nSHORT-SALE TRADING LIABILITIES  Short-sale trading liabilities in \\nour trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, where available.

       " Document(page_content='estimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to historical experience and other third-party data where available. \\nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our \\nmodel risk management policies and procedures, which include model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, processing components, logic or theory, output results and supporting model documentation. Validation also includes ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate given observable market transactions or other market data within the same or similar asset classes. \\nWe also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our \\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models continue to perform as expected, include: • ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions and other independent market data (including pricing vendors, if available); \\n• back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized transactions; and \\n• review of modeled valuation results against expectations, including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in value. \\nWe update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \\nreflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing \\nmodels are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model revalidations as necessary. \\nInternal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by \\nthe appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function \\nand monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. \\nIndependent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, \\nprovides independent oversight of model risk management, and its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk Committee. \\nVENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS  We routinely obtain pricing \\nfrom third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In certain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities that we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve and periodically review third-party vendors to ensure information obtained and valuation techniques used are appropriate. This review may consist of, among other things, obtaining and evaluating control reports issued and pricing methodology materials distributed. We monitor and review vendor prices on an ongoing basis to ensure the fair values are reasonable and in line with market experience in similar asset classes. While the inputs used to determine fair value are not provided by the pricing vendors, and therefore unavailable for our review, we perform one or more of the following procedures to validate the pricing information and determine appropriate classification within the fair value hierarchy: • comparison to other pricing vendors (if available); \\nWells Fargo & Company 165', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 184}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='The internal valuation techniques used for our Level 3 assets \\nand liabilities, as presented in Table 17.3, are described as \\nfollows:\\xa0• Discounted cash flow – Discounted cash flow valuation \\ntechniques generally consist of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of an instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. \\n• Market comparable pricing – Market comparable pricing valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of certain instruments by incorporating known inputs, such as recent transaction prices, pending transactions, financial metrics of comparable companies, or prices of other similar investments that require significant adjustment to reflect differences in instrument characteristics. \\n• Option model – Option model valuation techniques are generally used for instruments in which the holder has a contingent right or obligation based on the occurrence of a future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going above or below a predetermined strike price. Option models estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. \\nThe unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \\nthose we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset \\nor liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation. Following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table.\\xa0• Comparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to observed market data, such as a transaction price to reflect dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or other factors used within a market valuation approach, expressed as a percentage of an observed price. \\n• Conversion Factor – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a particular instrument may be exchanged for another instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage change from a specified rate. \\n• Correlation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument changing in price relative to another based on an established relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. \\n• Cost to service – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing such loan portfolios. \\n• Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a constant default rate (CDR). \\n• Discount rate – is a rate of return used to calculate the present value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at the fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium component. The benchmark rate component, for example, OIS, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or U.S. Treasury rates, is generally observable within the market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. The risk premium component reflects the amount of compensation market participants require due to the uncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting from risks such as credit and liquidity. \\n• Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio that are likely of not funding.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 188}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio that are likely of not funding. \\n• Initial-value servicing – is the estimated value of the underlying loan, including the value attributable to the embedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of outstanding unpaid principal balance. \\n• Loss severity – is the estimated percentage of contractual cash flows lost in the event of a default. \\n• Multiples – are financial ratios of comparable public companies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value of equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value, adjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial, or marketability to the comparable public company used in a market valuation approach. \\n• Prepayment rate – is the estimated rate at which forecasted prepayments of principal of the related loan or debt instrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant prepayment rate (CPR). \\n• Volatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is estimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. \\n• Weighted average life – is the weighted average number of years an investment is expected to remain outstanding based on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated date the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the instrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing of an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not contractually fixed. \\nInterrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \\nUsage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 17.3 requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. \\nCertain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a \\ndirectionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change in another input having a potentially muted impact to the overall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a change in one unobservable input may result in a change to another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify the fair value impact. \\nDEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE\\xa0 The internal models \\nused to determine fair value for these Level 3 instruments use certain significant unobservable inputs within a discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing valuation technique.

An increase in any of these unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the MSRs and alternatively, a decrease in any one of these inputs would result in the MSRs increasing in value. Generally, a decrease in discount rates increases the value of MSRs, unless accompanied by a related update to our prepayment rates. The cost to service assumption generally does not increase or decrease based on movements in the discount rate or the prepayment rate. The sensitivity of our residential MSRs is discussed further in Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities). \\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  Level 3 derivative instruments are \\nvalued using market comparable pricing, option pricing and discounted cash flow valuation techniques which use certain unobservable inputs to determine fair value.

       " Document(page_content='Note 17:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) \\nWe typically use a market approach to estimate the fair \\nvalue of our nonmarketable private equity and venture capital \\ninvestments in portfolio companies. The market approach bases the fair value measurement on market data (for example, use of market comparable pricing techniques) that are used to derive the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Market comparable pricing techniques may include utilization of multiples and recent or anticipated transactions (for example, a financing round, merger, acquisition or bankruptcy) involving the subject portfolio company, or participants in its industry or related industries. Based upon these recent or anticipated transactions, current market conditions and other factors specific to the issuer, we make adjustments to estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As a result of the recent market environment, we also utilized other valuation techniques. These techniques included the use of company risk factors in the estimation of the fair value of certain nonmarketable equity securities. The company risk factors are based upon entity-specific considerations including the debt and liquidity profile, projected cash flow or funding issues as well as other factors that may affect the company’s outlook. \\nFair Value Option \\nThe fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or liabilities, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the fair value option to align the measurement model with how the financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity \\nTable 17.7: Fair Value Option or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion of the portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS measured at fair value include \\nresidential mortgage loan originations for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist to reliably support our valuations. Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, and related\\xa0direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. We believe fair value measurement for LHFS reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. \\nAdditionally we purchase loans for market-making purposes \\nto support the buying and selling demands of our customers in our trading business. These loans are generally held for a short period of time and managed within parameters of internally approved market risk limits. Fair value measurement best aligns with our risk management practices. Fair value for these loans is generally determined using readily available market data based on recent transaction prices for similar loans. \\nTable 17.7 reflects differences between the fair value \\ncarrying amount of the assets for which we have elected the fair value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal amount at maturity. Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing included in LHFS for which we have elected the fair value option were insignificant at December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020. \\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 \\n(in millions) Fair value \\ncarrying \\namount Aggregate\\nunpaid \\nprincipal Fair value \\ncarrying \\namount\\xa0less \\naggregate\\nunpaid \\nprincipal Fair value \\ncarrying \\namount Aggregate \\nunpaid\\nprincipal Fair value \\ncarrying\\namount\\xa0less \\naggregate\\nunpaid\\nprincipal \\nLoans held for sale $ 15,895 15,750 145 18,806 18,217 589 \\nThe changes in fair value related to initial measurement and', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 191}),\n",

In determining the end of year benefit obligation, we assumed an average annual increase of approximately 7.50% for health care costs in 2022. This rate is \\nassumed to trend down 0.30%-0.40% per year until the trend \\nrate reaches an ultimate rate of 4.50% in 2030. The 2021 periodic benefit cost was determined using an initial annual trend rate of 7.80%. This rate was assumed to decrease 0.30%-0.40% per year until the trend rate reached an ultimate rate of 4.50% in 2030. \\nInvestment Strategy and Asset Allocation \\nWe seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a prudent level of risk, given the benefit obligations of the pension plans and their funded status. Our overall investment strategy is designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a moderate amount of long-term growth opportunities while ensuring that risk is mitigated through diversification across numerous asset classes and various investment strategies, coupled with an investment strategy for the fixed income assets that is generally designed to approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the Cash Balance Plan’s benefit obligations. The Cash Balance Plan currently has a target asset allocation mix comprised of the following ranges: 75%-85% fixed income, 10%-20% equities, and 0%-10% in real estate, private equity and other investments. The Employee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes several members of senior management, formally reviews the investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/ liability evaluations are also conducted. Other benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h) \\ntrust, which are invested with a target mix of 50%-60% equities and 40%- 50% fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree \\nMedical Plan Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust, which are predominantly invested in fixed income securities and cash. Members of the EBRC formally review the investment risk and performance of these assets on a quarterly basis. \\nProjected Benefit Payments \\nFuture benefits that we expect to pay under the pension and other benefit plans are presented in Table 21.7. \\nTable 21.7: Projected Benefit Payments \\nPension benefits \\nNon- Other', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 201}),\n",

This group of assets also includes highly liquid government securities such as U.S. Treasuries, limited partnerships valued at the NAV and collective investment funds described above. \\nDomestic, Global, International and Emerging Market Stocks  – \\ninvestments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at quoted market values. This group of assets also includes investments in registered investment companies and collective investment funds described above. \\nReal Estate  – includes investments in real estate, which are \\nvalued at fair value based on an income capitalization valuation approach. Market values are estimates, and the actual market price of the real estate can only be determined by negotiation between independent third parties in sales transactions. This group of assets also includes investments in exchange-traded equity securities and collective investment funds described above. \\nHedge Funds / Absolute Return  – includes investments in \\nregistered investment companies, collective investment funds, and limited partnerships, as described above. \\nOther  – insurance contracts that are stated at cash surrender \\nvalue. This group of assets also includes investments in registered investment companies and collective investment funds described above. \\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value \\ncalculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Eligible employees are 100% vested in their base and discretionary contributions after three years of service. A three-year service vesting requirement for matching contributions applies to employees hired after December 31, 2020. Base and matching contributions are made annually at year-end, and the discretionary contribution, if awarded, is made no later than the due date for the Company’s federal income tax return (including extensions) for the plan year.

We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized based on our history of earnings, sources of taxable income in carry back periods, and our ability to implement tax planning strategies. \\nAt December\\xa031, 2021, we had net operating loss and tax \\ncredit carry forwards with related deferred tax assets of $382\\xa0million. If these carry forwards are not utilized, they will mostly expire in varying amounts through December\\xa031, 2041.

The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments. \\nIn February 2021, we announced an agreement to sell \\nWells\\xa0Fargo Asset Management (WFAM), and in first quarter 2021, we moved the business from the Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to Corporate.

In addition, the CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for the Company included a stress capital buffer of 3.10% under the Standardized Approach and a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% under the Advanced Approach. The capital ratio requirements for the Bank included a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Company is required to maintain these risk-based capital ratios and to maintain an SLR of at least 5.00% (composed of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

The FRB conducts an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and has also published guidance regarding its supervisory expectations for capital planning, including capital policies regarding the process relating to common stock dividend and repurchase decisions in the FRB’s SR Letter 15-18.

These covered transactions may not exceed 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus (which for this purpose represents tier 1 and tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital rules, plus the balance of the ACL excluded from tier 2 capital) with any single nonbank affiliate and 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus with all its nonbank affiliates. Covered transactions that are extensions of credit may require collateral to be pledged to provide added security to the bank. \\nAdditionally, federal laws and regulations limit the \\ndividends that a national bank may pay. Dividends that may be paid by a national bank without the express approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are generally limited to that bank’s retained net income for the preceding two calendar years plus net income up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net income, as defined by the OCC, consists of net income less dividends declared during the period. Our national bank subsidiaries could have declared additional dividends of $5.1\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2021, without obtaining prior regulatory approval. We have elected to retain higher capital at our national bank subsidiaries to meet internal capital policy minimums and regulatory requirements. Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal \\nand state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December\\xa031, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), \\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – \\nIntegrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated \\nFebruary\\xa022, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \\nChange in Accounting Principle \\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition \\nand measurement of credit losses as of January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (CECL) . \\nBasis for Opinion \\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nCritical Audit Matters \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk \\ncharacteristics utilizing multiple credit loss models. The Company estimated the ACL for commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived through historical observation of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which forecast expected credit losses in the portfolio based on historical experience of delinquency and default rates and loss severity. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to measure expected credit losses. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to its historical loss rates, evaluated through historical observations of default and losses after default. A portion of the ACL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. \\nWells Fargo & Company 197', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2021-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 216}),\n",

The Company recognizes MSRs when it retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. \\nWe identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including \\nspecialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs.

At the same \\ntime, we are developing climate expertise in existing teams and using formal management steering committees and other forums to support specific initiatives and facilitate cross-functional efforts in a flexible way. In our view, this combined approach best balances the need for disciplined management governance and Board oversight, while enhancing our ability to adjust quickly to changing risks and opportunities. \\nAt its core, our approach underscores our view that the assessment, management, and oversight of climate-\\nrelated risks and opportunities should be integrated into the business of the Company. We view climate change as one of many drivers of the types of risk we already manage, with effects manifesting both in financial risk (credit, interest rate, market, and liquidity) and nonfinancial risk (strategic, reputational, and operational, which includes compliance and model risk). Climate-related opportunities are also important for us to understand. The transition to a lower-carbon economy creates new business models, new opportunities to finance customer transitions, and new industries requiring banking support. With these considerations factored into our governance approach, climate-related risks influence go-forward business planning, our risk and control infrastructure, and areas where topic-specific expertise is most needed.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/climate-disclosure.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

We provide a range of lending support for affordable multifamily \\nhousing and recognize the critical nexus between housing, climate, and equity. To address this challenge, Wells \\nFargo has funded philanthropic field-building activities to support emerging solutions and capacity building. Our efforts will help to scale growth in this area as part of $19.5 million in grants to support sustainability and climate resilience in underserved communities. A critical objective is to support models that bring a focus on enabling access to finance in vulnerable communities to reduce emissions but also to improve health, address energy burdens, and improve overall well-being. For example, we recently provided a $3.15 million grant to Elevate Energy to decarbonize approximately 100 homes (focused on one- to four-unit family homes) in low-income neighborhoods in Chicago as a pilot to demonstrate energy savings and performance for the purposes of scaling this model. The program also focused on connecting women and contractors of color with the \\ntraining and resources needed to take on clean energy projects as a way to grow their business. In addition, a $1.5 million grant from Wells Fargo to the Inclusiv Smart-E Loan program will help community development credit unions accelerate affordable sustainable financing for low- and moderate-income communities in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. An important goal of this program is for low-income households to access energy efficiency and decarbonization projects that help improve their home and lower utility costs. Finally, the Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future used a grant from our Company to create the Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future Multifamily Portfolio Carbon Emissions Calculator to allow affordable housing portfolio owners to calculate their annual GHG emissions.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/climate-disclosure.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

Risk is the possibility of an event occurring that could adversely affect our ability to achieve strategic or business objectives. We routinely take risks, within our risk appetite and approved exceptions, to achieve our business goals and serve our customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and nonfinancial risks, such as operational risk (which includes compliance and model risks), and strategic and reputation risks. Every employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining our control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nSenior management sets the tone at the top by supporting a strong culture, defined by Wells Fargo’s \\nexpectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to our customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. Wells Fargo’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations. \\nThe Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the Front Line, Independent Risk Management and \\nInternal Audit. Each line of defense has distinct risk management responsibilities. \\n• Front Line: The Front Line, which comprises our principal lines of business and certain enterprise function \\nactivities, is the first line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its business activities. \\n• Independent Risk Management: Independent Risk Management is the second line of defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk management program and provides oversight of, including challenge to and independent assessment and monitoring, the Front Line’s execution of its risk management responsibilities. \\n• Internal Audit: Internal Audit is the third line of defense.

A physical emissions intensity metric is expressed as a ratio of absolute emissions over a unit of output (for example, kilograms of CO2e per megawatt-hour). The choice between the metrics for target setting is determined based on assessment of the activities driving emissions in a given sector. \\nAs noted in the preceding table, we selected an absolute emissions metric for our Oil & Gas portfolio target. An \\nabsolute metric is well-suited not only to measure reductions in our Oil & Gas clients’ operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2), but also to capture reductions in Scope 3, category 11 (use of sold products) emissions resulting from clients transitioning into new businesses. For this metric, we measure client emissions attributable to our financing using an attribution factor that reflects our financing to each client relative to client value.\\n26 \\n25 See “Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks, ” (https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UNEP-FI-Guidelines-for-Climate-Change-Target-Setting. pdf) on p.6, U.N.

Commitments in the numerator are composed of both \\nfunded and unfunded components, while client value in the denominator represents on-balance sheet funding only. By adding unfunded commitments to client value, Wells Fargo reduces the over-allocation of emissions that would arise from an unadjusted approach. Note that a complete approach would entail the addition of all unfunded commitments from all lenders, but given data availability, we add only the unfunded portion of our commitment. Although this method risks overallocating emissions to Wells Fargo, we concluded that this approach would best align with the client relationship-based principles of CO2eMission.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/climate-disclosure.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

Though existing data-scoring methods provide universal guidance — often favoring company-reported emissions over asset-level data, we found that the quality of reported data varied significantly by sector.

While data related to our financing is available shortly after \\nyear-end, production and emissions data can lag behind by over a year or more. For an example of the data lag we experienced in reporting progress against our Oil & Gas and Power targets, see footnote 30. \\nAs we move forward, we plan to continue evaluating our carbon-intensive portfolios for target setting. In \\naddition to our target-setting activities, we are also preparing an emissions profile or “footprint” of our lending portfolios for the sectors for which we have set targets. We anticipate our initial approach to footprinting will be broadly consistent with the sectoral boundaries we employ for target setting. The absolute emissions footprint metrics we produce will complement the emissions intensity metric we use for our Power, Automotive, Aviation, and Steel portfolio targets and the separate absolute emissions-based metric we use for our Oil & Gas portfolio target.\\n29 Our approach to financed emissions footprinting will likely evolve over time in \\nresponse to industry trends, data availability, and regulatory requirements. \\nProgress toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets \\nTo provide some context for our progress toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets, we begin by briefly describing the targets, key methodological choices for the targets, and a change to our 2019 Power baseline measurement. \\nBackground \\nOur Oil & Gas portfolio target is an absolute emissions target that covers emissions from companies engaged in exploration and production activities (Scope 1, 2, and 3, category 11 (use of sold products)) and emissions from companies engaged in petroleum refining (Scope 1 and 2). Our Power portfolio target is an emissions intensity target that covers emissions from power-generating activities (Scope 1). The targets cover both lending and capital markets facilitation activities (and dedicated renewable energy financing for the Power sector) and are aligned to the NGFS Orderly Net Zero 2050 scenario released in June 2021. For more information on the Oil & Gas and Power targets, please see sections 3 and 4 in CO2eMission (PDF) . \\n29 The absolute emissions-based metric we use for our Oil & Gas target fixes client value as of certain dates to limit volatility. For a detailed description of how we calculate this metric, please see our CO2eMission document . Commonly used \\nmethodologies for developing emissions footprints, by contrast, typically apply a client value that corresponds to the year that a given footprint is intended to represent. We take the extra measure of fixing client value in our target metric, since year-over-year changes in client value can materially affect the emissions attributable to bank financing without any changes in underlying client emissions.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/climate-disclosure.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='52 Wells Fargo | 2022 TCFD Report Governance Strategy Risk management Metrics and targets \\nAt the time we calculated the 2019 baseline emissions intensity for our Power portfolio, we relied upon 2020 \\npower-generation data as a proxy to develop our 2019 baseline emissions intensity because 2019 power-generation data was not available from our data provider (see section 4.4 of CO2eMission (PDF) ). We \\nsubsequently received 2019 power-generation data and recalculated our 2019 baseline. Using the 2019 data, the baseline emissions intensity changed from 253 kg CO2e/MWh to 273 kg CO2e/MWh. This change in the baseline emissions intensity was expected and, in part, is further evidence of the ongoing transition that is currently occurring in the Power sector. Nonetheless, our target, which converges with the NGFS Orderly Net Zero 2050 scenario benchmark in 2030, remains unchanged. However, with the change in the 2019 baseline, the percent reduction in the portfolio’s emissions intensity to achieve the target has now increased from a 60% reduction to a 63% reduction. \\nProgress through December 31, 2021 \\nThe following table shows the progress made toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets from the 2019 baseline year through December 31, 2021.\\n30 \\nSector Metric 12/31/19 Baseline 12/31/21 Progress 2030 Target \\nOil & Gas Absolute emissions 97.7 81.1 72.3 \\n• Exploration and production (Scope 1, 2, and 3, category 11 (million metric tons of CO2e) MT CO2e MT CO2e MT CO2e \\n17% reduction from 26% reduction from \\n(use of sold products)) 2019 baseline 2019 baseline \\n• Refining (Scope 1 and 2) \\nPower \\n• Power generation (Scope 1) Emissions intensity 273 215 102 \\n(kilograms CO2e/ kg CO2e/MWh kg CO2e/MWh kg CO2e/MWh \\nmegawatt-hour) 21% reduction from 63% reduction from \\n2019 baseline 2019 baseline \\nAs shown in the previous table, the attributable emissions of our Oil & Gas portfolio decreased from a 2019 \\nbaseline of 97.7 MT CO2e to 81.1 MT CO2e (17% reduction). This decrease was driven mainly by three factors. Most of the decrease was driven by business-as-usual turnover in clients, including the impact of industry consolidation and restructuring activity from the COVID-19 downturn. Additional decreases were the result of reductions in borrowing bases for reserve-based lending facilities that took place during the 2019-2021 time \\n30 We source Company emissions data from S&P Trucost and GlobalData. S&P Trucost provides reported emissions data, which comes from a variety of sources. GlobalData provides production data, which we use to impute a client’s \\nemissions. For Oil & Gas, this production data is a combination of reported data and vendor estimated data (when reported data is not available). For Power generation, the production data is estimated from capacity and plant load (that is, utilization by fuel type) factor. Because S&P Trucost and GlobalData refresh this data frequently, the emissions data (as well as the percentage of reported versus estimated data) may vary depending on the date the data is extracted. For this progress report, S&P Trucost and GlobalData emissions data for 2021 was extracted on June 24, 2022, and July 6, 2022, respectively. Financing data, including loan commitments, amortized capital markets amounts, and dedicated renewable energy financing, reflects amounts as of December 31, 2021.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/climate-disclosure.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",

The reductions in borrowing \\nbases reduced our commitments and, consequently, the share of client emissions attributable to our financing. A minor part of this decrease was due to a reduction in client emissions, primarily as a result of production decreases and associated operational changes in 2020 in response to COVID-driven demand declines. \\nThe emissions intensity of our Power portfolio decreased from a 2019 baseline of 273 kg CO2e/MWh to 215 \\nkg CO2e/MWh (21% reduction) due primarily to an increase in our dedicated renewable energy financings, which have lower emissions intensities compared to our general purpose lending and capital markets facilitation activities. Additionally, our weighted average Power portfolio intensity also benefited from a modest reduction in average intensity across our nonrenewable portfolio due to clients generating more electricity from low- and zero-emission sources, such as wind and solar, and reducing reliance on higher-emitting sources. \\nPotential impacts to future progress \\nLooking ahead, we anticipate that progress toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets may not follow a straight line because realizing the assumptions supporting our targets depends upon several factors, many of which are outside our control. For example, the emissions intensity of our Power portfolio may increase if Power utilities continue the recent trend of selling their renewable energy assets and then purchasing electricity generated from these assets through power purchase agreements. As noted in CO2eMission , our methodology’s \\nintensity metric does not account for emission reductions attributable to power purchase agreements because clients do not uniformly disclose information associated with these agreements. If utilities shift from generating renewable energy through assets they own to selling these assets and purchasing the electricity they produce through power purchase agreements, our portfolio emissions intensity may increase without any change to emissions in the real economy. \\nMoreover, progress toward targets may be obscured by the lag between the time a client raises capital to \\nsupport its climate transition and the time it takes that client to invest in its own transformation. If a bank provides capital to a Power utility that is planning to develop a wind farm, for example, the client emissions intensity attributable to the bank will not reflect that wind farm until it is generating power — a process that can take months to years.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/climate-disclosure.pdf', 'page': 52}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='54 Wells Fargo | 2022 TCFD Report Governance Strategy Risk management Metrics and targets \\nProgress toward our targets may also be impacted by inherent volatility in the volume of capital markets \\nfacilitation, which is driven by the business and credit cycle. Additionally, progress toward our Oil & Gas target may be impacted by volatility in Oil & Gas commodity prices. These fluctuations may materially impact one or more inputs used to calculate client emissions attributable to our financing, and by extension, materially impact our target progress. \\nFor example, as Oil & Gas commodity prices increase, client value (that is, enterprise value and/or book value of \\ndebt and equity) may increase as it tends to be highly correlated with commodity prices. Given our approach for attributing client emissions to our financing activities,\\n31 an increase in client value may result in a decrease \\nin our financed emissions calculation, even if client emissions stayed the same or even increased. The opposite is also true; a decrease in client value may result in an increase in our financed emissions calculation, even if we did not increase our financing to the client .\\n32 \\nSimilar fluctuations may also be seen in reserve-based loans, where the size of the facility varies with underlying commodity prices. As Oil & Gas commodity prices increase, for example, the value of the Oil & Gas reserves that comprise the collateral for the loans would likely increase, which then increases the underlying borrowing base that governs the facility. This, in turn, drives a corresponding increase in our outstanding commitments to that client and consequently, an increase of our financed emissions calculation. \\nThough our target-setting methodology includes features designed to mitigate some of the \\nvolatility noted above (see section 2 of CO2eMission (PDF) ), we cannot control all factors that impact \\nthe assumptions supporting the targets. There remain numerous variables and assumptions embedded in our calculations that will drive volatility in our progress and may affect the accuracy in our reported results as noted herein and in CO2eMission. \\n31 As noted above and explained in CO2eMission , we attribute our Oil & Gas clients’ Scope 3 emissions to our financing using a balance sheet approach. Under this approach, the attribution factor reflects our financing to a client relative to \\nthe client’s value (Wells Fargo financing/client value). To measure client value, we use enterprise value including cash if the client is a publicly-traded company or the book value of debt plus equity if the client is a privately-held company.\\n32 For more information on how fluctuations in client value impact client emissions attributable to a financial institution, see, e.g., Jakob Thomä, Stan Dupré, and Michael Hayne. 2018. “A Taxonomy of Accounting Principles for Financial \\nPortfolios,” (https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/328 ) Sustainability 10, No. 2: 328, accessed March 14, 2023.

       " Document(page_content='55 Wells Fargo | 2022 TCFD Report Governance Strategy Risk management Metrics and targets \\nCO2eMission: Wells Fargo’s net-zero alignment and target-setting methodology \\nCO2eMission includes our methodological framework for setting targets to align our financial portfolios with our net-zero \\ngoal. Recognizing that each industry or sector of the real economy is unique, we have taken the approach of grouping our financial portfolios by industry and setting industry-specific targets, rather than a Companywide target, for our financial portfolios. This sector-based approach allows us to set targets informed by the trends and challenges each industry is facing. \\nTo set a sector-specific target, we consider a host of design choices. Our methodology endeavors to apply certain design \\nchoices universally across all sectors. For example, the decision to include both the financing we provide clients through lending activities and the financing we facilitate through debt and equity capital markets activities applies to all sectors. Other design choices, such as which metric or climate scenario to use for a target and which activities and emissions scopes to include, are made on a sector-specific basis. \\nOur methodology includes several key design features that distinguish it from other target-setting methodologies and \\nframeworks: \\n• The methodology uses committed exposure (credit available to a client) rather than outstanding exposure (funds drawn \\nfrom the available credit by a client) in attributing client emissions to the Company’s financing activities. Using committed exposure provides a more complete measurement of the funding we have agreed to provide to a client. \\n• The methodology measures client emissions attributable to our lending activities, as well as the capital markets activities we help facilitate. Although the NZBA and supporting industry frameworks and tools do not currently include funding arranged in the capital markets, we include it in our methodology to capture more fully financing activities in each sector. (We also include renewable tax equity financing for our Power target.) \\n• Our methodology amortizes capital markets facilitation activities over a five-year period to minimize potential volatility inherent in these activities. It also fixes client value as of certain dates to limit volatility due to changes in value for Oil & \\nGas clients\\n. \\n• To quantify clients’ emissions, we evaluate and prioritize available data sources on a sector-by-sector basis. In so doing, we \\nconsider the appropriateness of relying upon company-reported emissions versus asset-level production data collated by third-party data providers. Though existing data scoring methods often favor company-reported emissions over asset-level production data, the quality of company-reported emissions can vary across and within sectors. We are working with the Spatial Finance Initiative at the University of Oxford to empirically evaluate data quality on a sector-by-sector basis with a view to providing sector-specific data scoring guidance. \\nWe anticipate our methodology will evolve over time as approaches to net-zero mature, emissions data improves, and climate scenarios evolve. Moving forward, we intend to continue to address challenges and refine our approach.

       " Document(page_content='CEO Letter \\nDear Shareholders, \\nI’m proud to report that Wells Fargo continued to make \\nprogress on our priorities in 2022. Our underlying financial performance is improving, we are moving forward on our risk, control and regulatory agenda, we are focusing on businesses where we can generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns, we continue to strengthen the leadership team, and we are executing on our strategic objectives. While we have made progress, our work is not complete and we remain focused on successful and timely execution of our multi-year journey to complete our risk and control work and to move forward with our businesses. \\nStronger financial performance \\nOur financial performance benefitted as we continued to drive improved efficiency, and it was positively impacted by both rising rates and a benign credit environment. \\nIn 2022, Wells Fargo generated $13.2 billion in net income, or \\n$3.17 per common share. Our results were significantly impacted by $7 billion of operating losses, primarily related to putting historical issues behind us, including litigation, regulatory matters, and customer remediations. However, our performance excluding those items was solid and demonstrates the continued progress we are making to improve returns. \\nOur revenue decreased 6% from the previous year. The higher \\nrate environment and good loan growth drove strong growth in net interest income, which was up 26% from a year ago. However, this growth was more than offset by lower net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and other asset-based fees reflecting market conditions, as well as the lost revenue related to businesses we sold in 2021. \\nExpenses increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting higher \\noperating losses primarily related to putting historical matters behind us, as noted above. Excluding operating losses, noninterest expense declined from a year ago, reflecting continued progress on our efficiency initiatives and the impact from business sales. We achieved these efficiency gains while we made continued investments in our risk and control infrastructure and in strategic initiatives across our businesses, and in the face of continued inflationary pressures. \\nCredit quality remained strong, but, as expected, losses started \\nto slowly increase in the second half of the year off their historical lows. Our net charge-off rate declined from 18 basis points in 2021 to 17 basis points in 2022, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $75 million in 2022, as our reserve release in the first quarter was slightly larger than the reserve builds we had in the last three quarters of the year. \\nLoans outstanding increased by 7% from one year ago, with \\ngrowth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer Banking and Lending grew 4%, driven by growth in residential mortgage and credit card, which offset a decline in auto loans. Both Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking had strong loan growth, with commercial loans up 9% from a year ago, driven by growth across all asset classes. Average deposits in 2022 decreased 1% to $1.42 trillion, as higher market rates spurred customers to look for higher yielding alternatives, and consumers continued to spend savings that built up during the pandemic. \\nOur capital levels remained well above our required regulatory \\nminimums plus buffers. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2022 from $0.20 per share to $0.25 per share and then to $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022. While we did not repurchase any common stock in the last three quarters of 2022, we have repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2023. \\nOur return on equity was 7.5% and our return on tangible \\ncommon equity (ROTCE) was 9.0%\\n1. Both of these ratios were \\nimpacted by the operating losses I highlighted earlier. \\nIn my shareholder letter over the past two years, I have', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Both of these ratios were \\nimpacted by the operating losses I highlighted earlier. \\nIn my shareholder letter over the past two years, I have \\ndiscussed our path to higher returns. Since 2020, we have executed on a number of important items to improve our returns, including returning $16 billion to shareholders through net common stock repurchases, increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.30 per share, and delivering approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves. Based on these actions and others that are in flight, we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher returning businesses; execute on efficiency initiatives; and benefit from the investments we are making in our businesses. \\n1 Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure.

       " Document(page_content='We are actively watching the \\neconomy \\nConsumers \\nAfter a period of strong economic growth and low \\nunemployment, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates aggressively with a goal of combatting high inflation. Increasing interest rates and a slowing economy have caused headwinds for some of our customers, but our customers have largely remained resilient over the past year, with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. \\nConsumer credit card spend continued to be strong in 2022, \\nwith spending up 25% compared with 2021, which reflects the benefit of new Wells Fargo product launches. Almost all spending categories had double-digit spend growth year over year. Consumer debit card spend slowed to 3% growth in 2022 compared to 2021. Growth was driven by ticket size since transaction volume was flat year-over-year, and discretionary spend outpaced non-discretionary spend. \\nAt the same time, we are carefully watching the impact of higher \\nrates and we expect to see deposit balances continue to decrease and credit quality to continue to weaken. For certain cohorts of customers, average deposit balances are below pre-pandemic levels, and we are closely monitoring activity for signs of potential stress. For our borrowers, we are working to limit the risk – both to them and to us – of overextension. We have taken selective actions across our consumer lending businesses to mitigate risks associated with inflation and increased debt leverage. In our auto business, we have adjusted policies to address risk associated with collateral value declines and inflationary pressures on consumers’ ability to pay. In home lending, we have tightened loan-to-value policies nationally and even more so in local markets that have elevated home value risk. Additionally, in our card business, we have tightened our lending policy to focus on applicants who may be exhibiting debt-seeking behavior. \\nBusinesses \\nCommercial loans grew 9% in 2022, with most of the growth in \\nthe first half of the year. Higher inventory levels contributed to increased working capital needs, which drove higher utilization rates. However, utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year, and current data is not pointing to additional inventory builds, which indicates most businesses are carefully managing inventory levels amid slowing demand. \\nWe continue to closely monitor the most pandemic-impacted \\nsectors and inflation-sensitive industries in our commercial portfolio.

Specifically, we have issued underwriting guidance for navigating current conditions, including limited tolerance for new credit policy exceptions, increasing minimum debt yield thresholds, and stress testing and expansion of the watchlist process, including additional emphasis on the office market. \\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2023, we are prepared for a', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

As a large lender to both consumers and businesses in the United States, we have significant credit exposure across our businesses, and as the Federal Reserve continues to take action to reduce inflation, we will continue to monitor both the markets and our own customer data and will react accordingly. If our view of economic stress deteriorates from our view at the end of 2022, we will likely add to credit loss reserves during 2023. \\nMoving forward on our risk, control, \\nand regulatory agenda \\nWe continue to move forward with the foundational work of \\nbuilding out a risk and control framework appropriate for our company.

I am not in a position to agree or disagree with this premise, but I am in a position to have the strong point of view that Wells Fargo is not too big or complex to manage. Our shortcomings are not structural, but they are the result of historically ineffective management and the lack of proper prioritization of building out an appropriate risk and control environment that will ultimately take multiple years to correct. \\nii', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We are large but are far less complex than many with whom we \\ncompete. In fact, we have more similarities with regional banks than other global systemically important banks (GSIBs), and strong and effective risk management processes should scale to a company of our size. In addition, we have acted and will continue to act on our own to simplify our company and reduce operational complexity and risk, as I detail in the section later in this letter entitled “Executing on Strategic Objectives.” \\nOperating at a broad scale but with less complexity than peers \\n1. \\t We are primarily a US domestic bank and we do not have \\nthe many complexities that running large-scale international businesses bring. Our legal entity structure, extent of international regulatory oversight and physical footprint are far simpler than many of our competitors. Approximately 90% of our revenues come from U.S. clients or activities of non-U.S. clients in the U.S. Our businesses outside the U.S. primarily support our U.S. customer base. We are very happy with our existing footprint and are not looking beyond for growth opportunities. \\n2. \\t Our products are not complex compared with those offered by other banks and are similar to those offered by smaller institutions. We predominantly provide the same products and services as regional and smaller, more local banks. We take deposits, provide financing, move money, and provide financial advice for our customers. Our trading activities and the size of our market risk are relatively small compared to other large GSIBs. \\n3. \\t Scale in each of our businesses should not make us more complex. Our distribution methods are similar to smaller institutions. We manage a branch network, have relationship managers across our markets, market through the internet, traditional advertising, direct mail, and word of mouth, and we rely on our local reputation. The controls necessary to manage a network of 4,000+ branches are similar to those necessary to manage a smaller branch network. The same is true for managing relationship managers, marketing, and protecting our reputation. Senior management should be involved at a detailed level, but all institutions should have and rely on defined control frameworks in place that are effective at risk management, regardless of individuals in a seat. These frameworks can effectively scale to a bank of our size. \\n4. \\t Our customers benefit from our size and reach. Wells Fargo has nearly 4,600 retail bank branches, with a presence in 25 of the largest 30 markets in the U.S. A Wells Fargo branch or ATM is within 2 miles of over half of U.S. Census households and small businesses in our footprint. The range of banking services we provide helps us build full relationships with individuals and companies, allowing us to see a full picture of their personal, family, and/or business financial needs, and to meet these needs. We have the ability to invest in technology to make it faster, safer, and more transparent for our customers to handle their banking needs. In addition, our resources allow us to innovate quickly, developing new products, services, and digitized experiences to meet constantly changing consumer and business expectations. These capabilities, along with our size and reach, are of tangible benefit to consumers across the country, whether they live in large cities or more rural areas, and also to the U.S. economy as a whole. \\nManaging the company with significantly heightened discipline \\nWe agree that there are also traits that management should \\navoid as they grow. These signs are familiar to us, as we identified them as historical behaviors at Wells Fargo when I arrived. We viewed them then – as we do now – as unacceptable. Our approach today is dramatically different than it was at Wells Fargo in the past and we will continue to work so it becomes part of our culture at all levels in the organization. \\n1. \\t Don’t hide behind materiality – As a large institution we', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='1. \\t Don’t hide behind materiality – As a large institution we \\nknow we cannot let our size hide potential issues. We must think about raw numbers, not just percentages which are indexed to a large customer base, asset base, or capital base. We have built functions and processes to review customer complaints, employee allegations, and issues raised from outside the company, and aim to use them to identify issues and themes so we can address them and make changes as required. \\n2. \\t Don’t assume incidents are isolated – One of the advantages large institutions have is the amount of data and information we see and have, but we must use it expeditiously. Individual incidents provide data points which can help us learn and react, and we should treat each as such. We strive to make data-driven decisions and to explore whether incidents that can appear isolated can in fact have broader application elsewhere in the company. \\n3. \\t Identify weaknesses ourselves and address them quickly – The Acting Comptroller stated that “the business of banking is operationally intensive. Even at banks with strong teams and robust risk management systems and controls, mistakes and problems can arise. Well-managed banks identify such problems early and often, address them quickly, and take steps to prevent their recurrence.” We agree completely. Many of the historical issues we continue to work through were identified by regulators, not by us. We are changing this, emphasizing our responsibility to self-identify more issues and address them with a heightened sense of urgency. As we implement our risk and control framework, we will likely identify more issues and move with haste to implement compensating and ultimately permanent controls. Our risk and control framework is not a project, but an ongoing set of actions, and it will be part of our culture. \\n4. \\t Hubris, contempt, and indifference are unacceptable and dangerous traits – We cannot believe that we know better \\n2022 Annual \\nReport iii', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

It is critical to merge and \\nsimplify platforms, whether merger-related or as part of a \\ncustomer service strategy, as the reduced complexity in the \\nnumber of platforms should make it easier to properly serve \\ncustomers. For example, asking customer-service \\nrepresentatives to learn multiple systems to provide the \\nsame information creates more operational risk and the \\npossibility of a poor customer experience. \\n But these platform mergers should be the beginning of \\nintegration, not the end. This is true looking both from our \\nperspective and the customer perspective. Customers think \\nof us as one company, not as separate relationships with \\nindividual lines of business. They want to see their \\ninformation seamlessly and be able to transact with us \\neasily across all of their products. Unless we integrate our \\nplatforms, we will either not appear as one company to the \\ncustomer, or we will create workarounds to try and \\naccomplish this, which creates unneeded operational risk. A \\nmajor competitive advantage of Wells Fargo is serving our \\ncustomers across a broad range of products, but we can \\nonly do so effectively with common platforms. \\n The same is true of data platforms. Pulling customer data \\nfrom multiple platforms is operationally complex and \\nexpensive. Common data platforms across our company are \\ncritical. We rely on this for financial reporting, regulatory \\nreporting, risk reporting, and the ability to assess a \\ncustomer relationship holistically. \\n And finally, it is a mistake to lose sight of aged platforms, to \\nnot invest in improving them and to not move to new ones. \\nNew software and hardware solutions make it easier to \\nreduce complexity and properly serve customers, and when \\nthese solutions are part of a program with a clear target \\nstate, they should significantly reduce operational \\ncomplexity. \\n Recognizing this, Wells Fargo is implementing a modern \\ntechnology stack that is cloud-native and therefore more \\nelastic and resilient. We are applying this stack for the \\nvarious product domains that we are modernizing across \\nour businesses. Examples include a more modern digital \\ndesktop for our financial advisors in Wealth and Investment \\nManagement, our value-at-risk models in Corporate and \\nInvestment Banking, and our payment platforms across \\nbusinesses. These modernization initiatives are guided \\ntop-down by a product and platform architecture that sets clear boundaries and expectations for teams. In addition to \\nthis, the hosting of our platforms is more and more \\nmigrating to a combination of private and public cloud, \\npowered by our partnerships with Google and Microsoft. \\nThis also is leading to faster innovation by plugging in \\ninnovative services provided by these cloud providers into \\nour platforms. \\n In parallel to these modernization efforts, we are also \\nenhancing the way we deliver software and the developer \\nexperience. We are implementing new cloud-native tool-\\nchains that allow our developers to have the experience that \\nthey deserve: on-demand, instant, elastic and with \\nembedded automated controls. \\nFurther taking stock of where we stand – why haven’t we \\ncompleted our risk and regulatory work \\nI am frequently asked why our risk and regulatory work is not \\ncomplete though we have been publicly reprimanded, have a \\ngrowth constraint, and I have been leading the company for over', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

We have added close to 10,000 people \\nacross numerous risk- and control-related groups and have \\nspent approximately $2 billion more in 2022 than in 2018 in \\nthese areas. We are committed to make the investments \\nneeded to complete the work. \\n6. \\t And we had to build the management disciplines and \\nculture to govern and execute such a large body of work. \\nOur Operating Committee reviews risk and regulatory \\nprogress and escalations on a weekly basis. We provide \\ndetailed reporting to the full board and appropriate \\ncommittees so they can provide oversight. These reviews \\nare systematic and detailed, and they are helping us provide \\nthe appropriate oversight and involvement to accomplish \\nthe work. \\nI should add that we had to do all of this during the very worst of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. While we were not alone in dealing \\nwith the complexities of work from home, social distancing and \\nmeeting the needs of customers during a pandemic, we were \\nalone in what we had to build, and doing so in a remote working \\nenvironment increased the difficulty level significantly. \\nSome have suggested that banks view enforcement actions and \\nfines as a cost of doing business, but I can tell you that today, \\nnothing is further from the truth at Wells Fargo. We view any \\nsuch action by our regulators as something that requires \\nimmediate management attention. We aim both to avoid the \\nnecessity of such action by doing the work ourselves and, when \\nregulators do take enforcement action against us, we follow a \\ndisciplined process to work towards closure, again with all \\nnecessary resources available for the effort. \\nThe negative impact on our reputation of having not fulfilled our \\nobligations is clear. Simply put, failure to satisfy our regulatory \\nrequirements carries significant consequences for our company. \\nOn the other hand, fulfilling our obligations and building an appropriate risk and control framework will allow us to build a \\nstrong reputation amongst a broad set of stakeholders. So why \\ndo we have so many consent orders that have been open for \\nextended periods? Again, our historical practices were \\ninadequate, and it has taken time to build what is necessary to \\nchange our historical inadequacies. \\nSo as I look at our situation today, the failure of Wells Fargo to \\ncomplete its work appropriately has resulted in multiple consent \\norders, fines, and an asset cap. But I can say confidently that we \\nhave taken significant actions including focusing and simplifying \\nthe company, refreshing the board, replacing most of the senior \\nmanagement team, and are now moving forward to correct past \\ndeficiencies. We have the willingness and the ability to complete \\nthe work. \\nAnd to be clear, we are committed to prioritizing this work \\nabove all else by devoting all necessary resources to the effort.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='the work. \\nAnd to be clear, we are committed to prioritizing this work \\nabove all else by devoting all necessary resources to the effort. \\nOur planning is designed to ensure other activities do not \\ninterfere with this top priority. If we have a conflict, our risk and \\ncontrol work comes first. \\nI have said our progress will likely not be a straight line. We \\ncontinue to resolve issues that were found years ago or are the \\nresult of the inadequate control environment that existed when \\nwe arrived at the company. This means that resolution of \\noutstanding issues such as litigation, customer remediations or \\nregulatory investigations have and could continue to have \\nfinancial impacts. Additionally, until our work is complete, we will \\nlikely find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may \\nresult in additional regulatory actions. \\nFinally, as we continue to execute on our detailed plans, given \\nthe scope and complexity of our work, we may miss some \\ninterim milestones. We recognize the importance of meeting \\nmilestones that we ourselves set, but perfection is unlikely. \\nWhen we discover an issue, we act quickly to course-correct and \\ndo what we can to get back on schedule. This is frustrating for us \\nand others outside the company but is not indicative of our \\nwillingness or ability to complete our work. Rather, it is an \\nobstacle that presents itself in nearly any large-scale, multi-year \\ntransformation. \\nWhen Wells Fargo faces criticism about where we stand, I \\nunderstand the sentiment. I hope this section has provided \\ndetailed context and is helpful in providing an understanding of \\nwhat we are doing to close our gaps. This team is taking decisive \\naction to move our company past these issues. \\nLeadership Team \\nKey to transforming the company, changing our culture, and \\nrealizing the full strength of our franchise is having the best \\nmanagement team in place. Since I joined the company in 2019, \\n12 of our 17 Operating Committee members are new to Wells \\nFargo and 15 are new to their roles. In 2022, we put in place a \\nnew Chief Auditor, a new Chief Risk Officer, a new head of \\nConsumer Lending, and a new head of Diverse Segments, \\nRepresentation and Inclusion. \\n2022 Annual Report v', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We continue to refresh our management ranks more broadly. \\nOver 80% of our senior executive leaders – a group of approximately 150 people, most of whom report to Operating Committee members – are new to their roles since 2019, and nearly 60% are new to the company over the same time period. Over 30% of the individuals in this senior executive cohort began in new roles in 2022 or 2023. New leaders who have joined over the past several years bring important experience that is necessary for our journey. \\nExecuting on Strategic Objectives \\nSimplifying our business \\nWe continue to review the strategic positioning of the company \\nand are focusing our efforts on building products and services that are core to serving our clients. This focus has led us to decisions to sell, downsize, or curtail multiple businesses. These decisions simplify the company, reduce operational complexity and risk, and allow us to focus on both our core risk and control buildout and ways to serve our customers in our core franchises. There are several examples since I joined the company in 2019. \\nIn January 2023, we announced plans to simplify our Home \\nLending business and will primarily serve bank and wealth management customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. As part of this shift, we announced our plans to exit the Correspondent business, reduce the size of our Servicing portfolio, and optimize our Retail team so it aligns with our narrower customer focus. These actions will allow us to reduce risk in the Home Lending business while continuing making homeownership possible to thousands of Americans. \\nOver the past year, we have taken several additional steps to \\nsimplify the way we operate. For instance, we have: \\n•\\t Implemented a cloud-native operating model which will \\nenable us to reduce reliance on older, less stable platforms and allows us to innovate faster \\n•\\t Centrally organized our Control Management teams, to enable better coordination across our businesses \\n•\\t Streamlined our divisional leadership in Wells Fargo Advisors, moving from eight regional divisions to four \\n•\\t Combined Treasury Services platforms across Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking \\nLooking further back to 2021, 2020, and 2019, we have: \\n•\\t Sold Wells Fargo Asset Management \\n•\\t Sold our Corporate Trust Services business \\n•\\t Sold our student lending portfolio and stopped the \\norigination of new student loans \\n•\\t Exited our international wealth management segment \\n•\\t Sold our Canadian direct equipment finance business •\\t Stopped offering new home equity lines and loans \\n•\\t Exited the direct Auto business \\n•\\t Stopped originating personal lines of credit \\n•\\t Sold our Institutional Retirement and Trust business \\n•\\t In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. \\nGoing forward, we will continue to evaluate our businesses with an eye toward reducing complexity, increasing risk-adjusted returns, and focusing our resources on the most important products and services our customers require. Market dynamics change, the competitive environment changes, regulatory expectations evolve and we must adjust our business accordingly. \\nFocusing on customer needs and expectations \\nEach of our businesses is working to transform how we serve our \\ncustomers by offering focused, innovative products and solutions. Many of the initiatives underway reduce risk in the company and we evaluate new initiatives to consider the potential impact on our control environment.

For instance: \\n•\\t In Consumer and Small Business Banking, mobile active \\ncustomers grew 4% from a year ago. \\n•\\t The new credit cards I mentioned above helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, and we’ve continued to maintain strong credit profiles. The average FICO score of our new accounts in 2022 was 773, compared to 761 for the 2019 vintage. \\n•\\t In Wealth and Investment Management, total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. \\n•\\t Our U.S. investment banking market share was 3.2% in 2022, up 61 basis points versus 2021.

These efforts included: \\n•\\t The elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees \\nfor customers enrolled in Overdraft Protection. \\n•\\t Early Pay Day, making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. \\n•\\t Extra Day Grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. \\n•\\t And in the fourth quarter we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only, small-dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds.

As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would terminate. \\nConsent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities \\nOn September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business.

The required actions related to many of these matters were already substantially complete at the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent order lays out a path to termination after the Company completes the remainder of the required actions. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. \\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCustomer Remediation Activities \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and implement additional operational and control procedures.

Recent Developments \\nLIBOR Transition The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. \\nIn first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) \\nAct (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in U.S. law contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our legacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate fallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement rates specified in the FRB’s final rule. \\nWe no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR, subject \\nto limited exceptions based on regulatory guidance. During 2022, we executed certain LIBOR transition activities to enhance our operational readiness such as the development of new alternative reference rate products, model and system updates, and employee training. \\nFor certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities \\nand related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with our clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR-based rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the June 30, 2023 cessation date. \\nFollowing June 30, 2023, we expect substantially all of our \\nconsumer loans, commercial credit facilities, debt securities, derivatives, and long-term debt indexed to USD LIBOR to transition to SOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in accordance with existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. \\nFor additional information regarding the risks and potential \\nimpact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section in this Report. \\nWells Fargo & Company 3', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. Net interest income and net interest margin increased in \\n2022, compared with 2021, due to the impact of higher interest rates on earning assets, higher loan balances, and lower mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, partially offset by lower interest income from Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and loans purchased from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization pools, and higher expenses for interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt . \\nTable 3 presents the individual components of net interest \\nincome and net interest margin.

       " Document(page_content='Earnings Performance (continued)\\n \\nOperating Segment Results \\nOur management reporting is organized into four reportable         \\noperating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending;       Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and        Wealth and Investment Management. All other business        activities that are not included in the reportable operating          segments have been included in Corporate. For additional         information, see   Table 8  . We define our reportable operating       segments by type of product and customer segment, and their           results are based on our management reporting process. The          management reporting process measures the performance of        the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s         management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed         with our Chief Executive     Officer  and relevant senior    \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on         U.S.  GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds         transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenu       e  and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to       consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt        sources, which allows management to assess performance        consistently across the operating segments.     \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that \\nreturn on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment’s use of capital.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

Risk is the possibility of an \\nevent occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \\nto achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model risks, and strategic and reputation risks. \\nRisk Profile. The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \\naggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \\nbusiness activities after taking into consideration risk management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \\nRisk Capacity. Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \\nthe Company could assume given its current level of resources \\nbefore triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital and liquidity needs. \\nRisk Appetite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk \\ncapacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current \\nlevel of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \\nRisk and Strategy. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \\nCompany’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \\nCompany’s most significant opportunities and challenges, develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s evaluation. \\nRisk and Climate Change.

The Company is committed to helping \\nmitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities \\nand to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. Risk is Managed by Everyone. Every employee, in the course of \\ntheir daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nRisk and Culture. Senior management sets the tone at the top \\nby supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to the Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations. \\nRisk Management Framework. The Company’s risk \\nmanagement framework sets forth the Company’s core \\nprinciples for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by \\nbuilding an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We continue to enhance and mature our risk management programs, including operational and compliance risk management programs as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s April 20, 2018, consent orders. \\nRisk Governance \\nRole of the Board. The Board oversees the Company’s business, \\nincluding its risk management. It assesses senior management’s performance and holds senior management accountable for maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management program. \\nBoard Committee Structure. The Board carries out its risk \\noversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. \\nThe Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk management framework and oversees management’s implementation of the framework, including how the Company manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee and administratively to the CEO. \\nWells Fargo & Company 28', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n",

Our evaluation is based on the most current financial information available and is focused on various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us based on our analysis as well as other lenders’ experience with the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance for credit losses methodology. \\nIn considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate \\nthe collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. \\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE) Our CRE loan portfolio is \\ncomprised of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had $11.3 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2022, compared with $13.1 billion at December 31, 2021, and $1.1 billion of CRE construction loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2022, compared with $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in criticized CRE loans was driven by the hotel/motel and shopping center property types, as these property types continued to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the office buildings and apartment property types. Criticized CRE loans at December 31, 2022, increased compared with September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the office buildings property type. The credit quality of the office buildings property type could continue to be adversely affected if weakened demand for office space continues to drive higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. At December 31, 2022, nearly one-third of the CRE loans in the office buildings property type had recourse to a guarantor, typically through a repayment guarantee, in addition to the related collateral.

We monitor t\\nhe risk of default as a \\nresult of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the majority of this portfolio at December 31, 2022. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. \\nThe residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of \\nresidential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are \\nprimarily amortizing \\npayment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan is delinquent. \\nThe outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of \\ncredit was \\n$18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded \\ncredit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $35.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2022\\n, a significant portion of the lines of credit in \\na draw period used the interest-only option. The lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL for loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were approximately 2% and 3% of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nDuring the draw period, the borrower has the option of \\nconverting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. \\nIn anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit \\nborrowers reaching the end of their draw period, we have created a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. \\nWells Fargo & Company 36', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 45}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying \\neconomic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our \\nresidential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate the market value of homes. We have processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when AVMs may be used. For additional information about our use of appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nPart of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, \\ncurrent FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values (LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit line products) to property collateral value. For additional information regarding credit quality indicators, see \\nNote 5 (Loans \\nand Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist \\nhomeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness. These programs generally include trial payment periods of three to four months, and after successful completion and compliance with terms during this period, the loan is permanently modified. Loans included under these programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) at the start of the trial period or at the time of permanent modification, if no trial period is used. Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of delinquencies.

Loans that are not re-underwritten or loans that lack sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time of modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been modified, if the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual status and may be returned to accruing status when the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status, and a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the modified agreement will not be collectible.

As servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. \\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \\ntransfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these repurchased loan balances were $9.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively, which included $8.6 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. \\nRepurchased loans that regain current status or are \\notherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has timely made six consecutive payments.

The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices.

       " Document(page_content='Asset/Liability Management \\nAsset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and \\nmanaging interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. \\nAt the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability \\nCommittee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending and deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: •\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tassets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different \\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; \\n•\\tassets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; \\n•\\tshort-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently; \\n•\\tthe remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or \\n•\\tinterest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. \\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 32,', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in \\nTable 32: \\n•\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tSimulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities. \\n• Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant. •\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tMortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. \\n• Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory.

       " Document(page_content='MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We \\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer demand, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest rates. \\nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \\nsubjective and involve complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions captured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional information on the valuation of our residential MSRs. \\nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the \\npropensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the servicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \\nresidential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged. \\nThe size of the hedge and the particular combination of \\nhedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our mortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",

Our historical simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is responsive to current market conditions.

Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves. \\nStress Testing While VaR captures the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These scenarios assume that the market moves happen instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). \\nAn inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \\nhistorical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress \\nWells Fargo & Company 48', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

We make and manage direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. These private equity investments are made within capital allocations approved by management and the Board. The Board reviews business developments, key risks and historical returns for the private equity investment portfolio at least annually. Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable price changes that are similar to the investments held. Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and the measurement alternative. \\nAs part of our business to support our customers, we trade \\npublic equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also have marketable equity securities that include investments relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these marketable equity securities are recognized in net income.

Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. \\nThere were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies \\nwith regard to our credit ratings during fourth quarter 2022. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional \\ninformation regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and operations as well as \\nNote 14 (Derivatives) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade. \\nThe credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., \\nas of \\nDecember 31, 2022, are presented in Table 38. \\nTable 38: Credit Ratings as of December 31, 2022', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Capital Management   \\n\\t\\nWe have an active program for managing capital through a \\ncomprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and share repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at December 31, 2022, increased $7.3 billion from December 31, 2021, predominantly as a result of $13.2 billion of Wells Fargo net income, partially offset by $5.4 billion of common and preferred stock dividends. During 2022, we issued $1.8 billion of common stock, substantially all of which was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. In 2022, we repurchased 110 million shares of common stock at a cost of $6 billion. In 2022, our AOCI decreased $11.7 billion, predominantly due to net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the amount of our risk-based capital. For additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section below. \\nIn 2022, we redeemed $609 million of preferred stock. For \\nadditional information, see Note 11 (Preferred Stock) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nRegulatory Capital Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company \\nis subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 39 and Table 40 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.

The countercyclical buffer in effect at December 31, 2022, was 0.00%. \\nThe capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain \\ninstitutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress. \\nWells Fargo & Company 52', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease \\nin a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse \\nscenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is 3.20%. \\nAs a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also           \\nsubject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital          surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio         requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually          calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher          of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers           our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity,      substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the       methodology developed by the     BCBS  and the Financial Stability     Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar          inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term         wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2023. \\nUnder the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \\nand credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). \\nThe tables that follow provide information about our risk-\\nbased capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III capital rules.

The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for effective senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks. \\n•\\t\\t Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",

Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a          reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the          U.S.  Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable          period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates th           e  risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the           financial stability of the United States.

If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings.

In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related Support Entities”).

Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. \\nIn addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \\nperiodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support.

Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: \\n•\\t\\t the allowance for credit losses; \\n•\\t\\t the valuation of residential MSRs; \\n•\\t\\t the fair value of financial instruments; \\n•\\t\\t income taxes; \\n•\\t\\t liability for contingent litigation losses; and \\n•\\t\\t goodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit Committee. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFor loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured \\nbased on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information.

       " Document(page_content='Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \\nfor credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considerations include the evaluation of past events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nJudgment is specifically applied in: \\n•\\t\\t Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period. We forecast a wide range of economic variables to estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. \\n•\\t\\t Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n•\\t\\t Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. Individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. \\n•\\t\\t Usage of credit loss estimation models. We use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are independently validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. We routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation.

The sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately $7.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results.

       " Document(page_content='Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) \\nMSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from third parties. We also have acquired MSRs in the past under co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. \\nWe carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans \\nat fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are reflected in earnings. \\nWe use a model to estimate the fair value of our \\nresidential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and require judgment to determine. If observable market indications do become available, these are factored into the estimates as appropriate: \\n•\\t\\t The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future net servicing income. The prepayment rate is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \\n•\\t\\t The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). In 2022, we enhanced our approach for estimating the discount rate to a more dynamic methodology for market curves and volatility. \\n•\\t\\t The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net servicing income. The cost to service loans includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market participant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our actual costs may vary from that estimate. \\nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \\nand generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value estimate to independent appraisals. \\nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFair Value of Financial Instruments', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",

When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that generally use market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internal models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. \\nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs,', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 72}),\n",

Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of many factors, including market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market participant would require in light of the illiquid market. \\nWe continually assess the level and volume of market \\nactivity in our debt and equity security classes in determining adjustments, if any, to quoted prices.

Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize.

For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions. \\nWe apply judgment when establishing an accrual for \\npotential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual.

The Update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023, with retroactive application to prior periods. The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholder’s life once the account values are exhausted.

The adjustment for the impact of our own credit risk recorded as an increase to other comprehensive income was approximately $15 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2023. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions.

The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon adoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The Update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets. \\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 days after the adoption date. \\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost of $23.9 billion from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale and designated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method.

If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our products, including our consumer and commercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings. \\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which \\nmay erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, markets and investment banking businesses. For example, because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively affect the performance of products we have provided to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture capital business and trading activities, including through heightened counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global financial markets and economies, including as a result of any international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely affect the revenue and earnings of our international operations, particularly our global financial institution and correspondent banking services. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” sections in this Report.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect \\nour yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may continue to negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023. \\nChanges in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread \\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates – could also reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the FRB. \\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \\nour earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based on changes in interest rates. \\nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \\nis always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions, as', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 79}),\n",

Market disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or restrictions; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws on lines of credit; and, as described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings.

The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. \\nIn addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced \\ncapital and risk-management standards on large financial firms pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital plan rule that establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo.

Although not currently anticipated, new capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.

       " Document(page_content='FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023 to address high inflation. As noted above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest margin. \\nCREDIT RISKS \\nIncreased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \\nWhen we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading and other activities. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. \\nFuture allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \\nvariety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2022, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nCredit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report.', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n",

Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or geography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in such industries to meet their financial obligations. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, including the Central Valley California market and several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses.

Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there have been and could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information security incidents. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.

Those parties also may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or other information to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Geopolitical matters, such as the conflict in Ukraine, may also elevate the risk of an information security threat, particularly by foreign state-sponsored parties or their supporters.

Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance.

Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct.

We earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase due to a decline in the likelihood of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. \\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \\nour mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. \\nWe rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet \\ntheir conforming loan requirements and on government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring agencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be used to originate new loans. \\nWells Fargo & Company 80', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 89}),\n",

We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors.

If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, including successors for senior leadership positions, our business performance, competitive position and future prospects may be adversely affected. \\nFINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS \\nChanges in accounting standards, and changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect our financial results and condition. From time to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially affect our financial results and condition, including requiring a retrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. Similarly, any change in our accounting policies could also materially affect our financial statements. For additional information, see the “Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report. \\nOur financial statements require certain assumptions and estimates and rely on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, among other items, in determining the allowance for credit losses, the liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as debt securities, loans held for sale, MSRs, derivative assets and liabilities, and equity securities. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial results are incorrect or different from actual results, we could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be significant.

       " Document(page_content='Notes to Financial Statements \\n-See the “Glossary of Acronyms“ at the end of this Report for terms used throughout the Financial Statements and related Notes. \\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nWells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company. We provide banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the financial services industry. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including: \\n•\\t\\t allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses)); \\n•\\t\\t valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \\n•\\t\\t valuations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)); \\n•\\t\\t liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal Actions)); \\n•\\t\\t income taxes (Note 22 (Income Taxes)); and \\n•\\t\\t goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022 \\nIn 2022, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \\n•\\t\\t Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2020-06 – Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity \\n•\\t\\t ASU 2021-05 – Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments \\n•\\t\\t ASU 2021-10 – Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

When our consolidated subsidiaries follow specialized industry accounting, that accounting is retained in consolidation. \\nWe are also a variable interest holder in certain entities in \\nwhich equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or where the entity does not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties (collectively referred to as variable interest entities (VIEs)). Our variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair value of the entity’s net assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary, which is when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of \\nWells Fargo & Company 91', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. \\nSignificant intercompany accounts and transactions are \\neliminated in consolidation. When we have significant influence over operating and financing decisions for a company but do not own a majority of the voting equity interests, we account for the investment using the equity method of accounting, which requires us to recognize our proportionate share of the company’s earnings. If we do not have significant influence, we account for the equity security under the fair value method, cost method or measurement alternative. \\nNoncontrolling interests represent the portion of net \\nincome and equity attributable to third-party owners of consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned by Wells Fargo. Substantially all of our noncontrolling interests relate to our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash \\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are recorded at amortized cost and include cash on hand, cash items in transit, and amounts due from or held with other depository institutions. See Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) for additional information on the restrictions on cash and cash equivalents. \\nTrading Activities \\nWe engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. These activities predominantly occur in our Corporate and Investment Banking reportable operating segment. Trading assets and liabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for sale, derivatives and short sales, which are reported within our consolidated balance sheet based on the accounting classification of the instrument. In addition, debt securities that are held for investment purposes that we have elected to account for under the fair value method, are classified as trading. \\nOur trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net gains from trading and securities within noninterest income.

We also take positions to manage our exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold financial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short positions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the purchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the anticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an offsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure to the customer transaction. We earn income based on the transaction price difference between the customer transaction and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded. \\nOur market-making activities include taking long and short \\ntrading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These activities are typically executed on a short-term basis. As a market-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference between the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the positions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading positions held on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we may enter into separate derivative or security positions to manage our exposure related to our long and short trading positions taken in our market-making activities.

AFS debt securities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amount reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) is net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and applicable income taxes. Investments in debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are measured at amortized cost, net of ACL.

For purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the next call date using the effective interest method. As principal repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. \\nWe recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \\nsecurities in net gains from trading and securities within noninterest income using the specific identification method. \\nIMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 101}),\n",

See Table 1.1 for key economic variables used for our loan portfolios. \\nTable 1.1: Key Economic Variables \\n Loan Portfolio   Key economic variables \\n Total commercial •       Gross  domestic  product \\n•       Commercial  real  estate  asset  prices,  where  applicable \\n•       Unemployment  rate \\n Residential mortgage •       Home  price  index \\n•       Unemployment  rate \\n        Other consumer (including credit card, auto, and other consumer) •       Unemployment  rate \\nOur approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses         \\nfor loans and debt securities includes the following key          components: \\n• An initial loss forecast period      of two years for all portfolio       segments and classes of financing receivables and off-        balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects       management’s expectation of losses based on forward-       looking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast         multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base         scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more          pessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by        management to estimate future credit losses.      \\n• Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting        to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the             economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast         period. These long-term averages are based on observations         over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which         may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis.            • The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for           expected prepayments and certain expected extensions,       renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term         when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual          renewals or extension options. We also incorporate any         scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an         extension through a TDR. Credit card loans have         indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine        a contractual life by estimating the application of future          payments to the outstanding loan amount.      \\n• Utilization of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to         measure credit impairment for loans modified in a troubled          debt restructuring, unless they are collateral dependent and         measured at the fair value of the collateral. The DCF           methods obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the         initial and historical mean loss forecast periods described         above. \\n• For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests         classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the           \\nWells Fargo & Company 95', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",

For most HTM        \\ndebt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss           \\nmodel, similar to the methodology used for loans.        \\nThe ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \\nvaluation account that is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. When credit expectations change, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported in provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off are subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a negative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was previously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot have an associated negative allowance. \\nFor certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \\nloans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. Treasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not recognized an ACL as our expectation of loss is zero, based on historical losses and consideration of current and forecasted conditions. \\nFor financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we will \\nmeasure the ACL based on the fair value of the collateral. If we intend to sell the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the collateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial real estate or other business assets. \\nWe do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 105}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest \\nreceivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we include an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are neither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan is 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans. \\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO S    EGMENT AC  L METHODOLOGY    \\nGenerally, commercial loans, which include net investments in lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the event of default, considering the quality of any underlying collateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of default, and exposure at default are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default within each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as appropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted economic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit commitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to derive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated probability of default and loss severity at the time of default are applied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments. \\nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For \\nconsumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer portfolio. \\nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for \\nqualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES Our off-balance sheet', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 105}),\n",

For off-balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated \\nfor expected credit losses. These other financial assets include accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts receivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss expectation (e.g., government guarantee) based on no historical credit losses and consideration of current and forecasted conditions. Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. A provision for credit losses is not recognized \\nWells Fargo & Company 96', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 105}),\n",

These provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these financial assets. \\nSee Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \\nfor additional information. \\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \\nFinancial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \\nLeasing Activity \\nAS LESSOR We lease equipment to our customers under \\nfinancing or operating leases. Financing leases, which includes both direct financing and sales-type leases, are presented in loans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-party investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual lease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The residual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales price for the equipment at lease termination based on sales history adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. Many of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at prevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at lease termination. \\nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 106}),\n",

Beneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and subordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain beneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to time, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new securitization transaction.

If, by individual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. Premises and Equipment \\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We use the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for premises and equipment was $1.2 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, up to 10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the estimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for leasehold improvements. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill is recorded for business combinations when the purchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net assets, including identifiable intangible assets. \\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level \\non an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. We have determined that our reporting units are at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We identify the reporting units based on how the segments and reporting units are managed, taking into consideration the economic characteristics, nature of the products and services, and customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a significant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion of goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested business. \\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \\nof goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge to other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying value of goodwill.

This process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item using the regression analysis method. \\nDISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge \\naccounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, or (4) when the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a cash flow hedge. \\nWhen we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no \\nlonger adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value.

If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the applicable requirements, including determining the legal enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments (CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives. \\nCash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate \\nderivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to separate non-derivative receivables or payables. This cash collateral, also referred to as variation margin, is exchanged based upon derivative fair value changes, typically on a one-day lag. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities, see \\nNote 14 (Derivatives). \\nEquity Securities \\nEquity securities exclude investments that represent a controlling interest in the investee. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are predominantly used in our trading activities.

The securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income; \\n•\\t\\t Equity method: This method is applied when we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee. The securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of the investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received and/or impairments. Equity method adjustments for our share of the investee’s earnings or losses are recognized in other noninterest income and dividends are recognized as a reduction of the investment carrying value; \\n•\\t\\t Proportional amortization method: This method is applied to certain low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. The investments are initially recorded at cost and amortized in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized in income tax expense; \\n•\\t\\t Cost method: This method is required for specific securities, such as Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock. These securities are held at cost less any impairments; \\n•\\t\\t Measurement alternative: This method is followed by all remaining nonmarketable equity securities. These securities are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value as of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the same or similar security of the same issuer. These securities are also adjusted for impairments. \\nAll realized and unrealized gains and losses, including \\nimpairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are \\nrecognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity securities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in interest income. \\nOur review for impairment for nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to sell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and the viability of its business model. When the fair value of an equity method or cost method investment is less than its carrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary. When the fair value of an investment accounted for using the measurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value, without the consideration of anticipated recovery. \\nSee Note 4 (Equity Securities) for additional information. \\nPension Accounting \\nWe sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of Wells\\xa0Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans  that provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to certain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit pension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions used in determining the net periodic pension cost and the pension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and projected mortality rates. \\nA single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate \\nthe present value of our future pension benefit obligations.

The full yield curve approach aligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected benefit payment cash flows. This change does not affect the measurement of our pension obligation as the change in interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain (loss). We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate to our pension expense. Previously, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate. We made this change to improve the correlation between the yield curve and the projected benefit payment cash flows. \\nThe determination of our expected long-term rate of return \\non plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected returns using forward-looking capital market assumptions. We use the resulting projections to derive a baseline expected rate of return for the Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \\npublished by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our specific experience. \\nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \\nliabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting actuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from AOCI into net periodic pension cost over the estimated average remaining participation period, which at December\\xa031, 2022, is 18 years. See Note 21 (Employee Benefits) for additional information on our pension accounting. \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize.\\xa0An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement.\\xa0Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \\nSee Note 22 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for a further description of our provision for income taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities.

Awards to employees who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who become retirement eligible before the final vesting date are expensed between the grant date and the date the employee becomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment ends. \\nPSAs and certain RSRs granted in 2020 included \\ndiscretionary conditions that can result in forfeiture and are measured at fair value initially and subsequently until the discretionary conditions end. For these awards, the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in our stock price. Awards granted in 2022 and 2021 no longer included these discretionary conditions and are not adjusted for subsequent changes in stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also fluctuates based on the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions.\\xa0The total expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized upon the completion of the performance period. \\nFor additional information on our stock-based employee \\ncompensation plans, see Note 12 (Common Stock and Stock Plans). \\nEarnings Per Common Share \\nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. \\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \\nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \\nare required to record them at fair value, when we have elected the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to fair value only as required through the application of an accounting method such as LOCOM, write-downs of individual assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain nonmarketable equity securities. \\nWells Fargo & Company 101', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 110}),\n",

The three levels are as follows: •\\t\\t Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. \\n•\\t\\t Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. \\n•\\t\\t Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions that are not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of discounted cash flow models, market comparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar techniques. \\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to \\nassess the appropriate classification of financial instruments \\nwithin the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly.

The consent orders require remediation to customers and the payment of a total of $1.0 billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their behalf. Multiple putative class actions alleging, among other things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI policies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into one multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district litigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class action against the Company and its executive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to two alleged misstatements. Subject to court approval, the parties have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay $300 million to resolve this action. In addition, the Company was subject to a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that customers were entitled to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the class action. Allegations related to the CPI and GAP programs were among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which has been dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues related to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer auto loans, including related insurance products. On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. The consent order requires, among other things, remediation to customers and the payment of a $1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB.

In May 2022, the district court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In January 2023, the parties voluntarily dismissed the appeal. \\nCOMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, \\nincluding the United States Department of Labor (Department of Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve the Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with certain of these transactions. \\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells Fargo \\nshareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors made false or misleading statements regarding the Company’s efforts to comply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal Reserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the Company’s efforts to comply with these three consent orders are also among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in California state court. \\nCONSUMER DEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY \\nINVESTIGATIONS The CFPB has undertaken an investigation into \\nwhether customers were unduly harmed by the Company’s \\nhistorical practices associated with the freezing (and, in many cases, closing) of consumer deposit accounts after the Company \\nWells Fargo & Company 137', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 146}),\n",

As described above, on December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. \\nHIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government agencies, including the \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. A putative securities fraud class action has also been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its executive officers made false or misleading statements about the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity.

       " Document(page_content='INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately $6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately $94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled while others remain pending. \\nMORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmortgage borrowers filed separate putative class actions alleging that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys’ fees that were included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into settlements to resolve the class actions, while the others were voluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding these and other mortgage servicing matters. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business and insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order. In addition, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. As described above, on December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. \\nNOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In August \\n2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. In March 2022, Wells Fargo entered into an agreement to settle the six actions filed by Nomura, and the actions have been voluntarily dismissed. In the remaining action filed by Natixis, Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of its \\nWells Fargo & Company 138', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",

We do not believe any funds related to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and has been cooperating with investigations or inquiries arising out of this matter by federal government agencies. The Company is in resolution discussions with certain of these agencies, although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. \\nRECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS The United States Securities \\nand Exchange Commission and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission have undertaken investigations regarding the Company’s compliance with records retention requirements relating to business communications sent over unapproved electronic messaging channels. \\nRETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS Federal and state government', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",

On February 21, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of Justice’s criminal investigation into the Company’s retail sales practices as well as a separate agreement to resolve the Department of Justice’s civil investigation. As part of the Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will be filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all the terms of the agreement. The Department of Justice criminal settlement also includes the Company’s agreement that the facts set forth in the settlement document constitute sufficient facts for the finding of criminal violations of statutes regarding bank records and personal information. On February 21, 2020, the Company also entered into an order to resolve the SEC’s investigation arising out of the Company’s retail sales practices. The SEC order contains a finding, to which the Company consented, that the facts set forth include violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. As part of the resolution of the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, the Company made payments totaling $3.0 billion. The Company has also entered into agreements to resolve other government agency investigations, including investigations by the state attorneys general. In addition, a number of lawsuits were filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into various settlements to resolve these lawsuits. \\nRMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \\nLimited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. Wells Fargo filed a petition to remove the case to federal court, but the case was remanded back to state court. \\nOUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 139', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Note 14: Derivatives\\n\\t\\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading or other purposes. \\nRisk Management Derivatives \\nOur asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and earnings. In a fair value or economic hedge, the effect of change in fair value will generally be offset by the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income. Customer Accommodation Trading \\nWe also use various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, as an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve engaging in market-making activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security transactions. These customer accommodations and any offsetting derivatives are treated as customer accommodation trading and other derivatives in our disclosures. Additionally, embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contracts are included in the customer accommodation trading and other derivatives disclosures, as applicable. \\nWells Fargo & Company 140', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 149}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges \\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical commodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 24 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial loans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. \\nWe estimate $695 million pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at December 31, 2022, will be reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022, we are hedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of 10 years.

Loan commitments         for mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered           derivatives.

Customer Accommodation Trading and Other For customer accommodation trading purposes, we use swaps, futures, forwards, spots and options to assist our customers in managing their own risks, including interest rate, commodity, equity, foreign exchange, and credit contracts. These derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter into derivatives for risk management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading and other derivatives also \\ninclude embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contract. We periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and certificates of deposit (CDs) where the performance of the hybrid instrument note is linked to an equity, commodity or currency index, or basket of such indices. These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the note in a manner similar to a derivative instrument and therefore are considered to contain an “embedded” derivative instrument. The indices on which the performance of the hybrid instrument is calculated are not clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The “embedded” derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative. Additionally, we may invest in hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives, such as credit derivatives, that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract.

       " Document(page_content='Credit Derivatives \\nCredit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is \\nderived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to another party (the seller of credit protection). We generally use credit derivatives to assist customers with their risk management objectives by purchasing and selling credit protection on corporate debt obligations through the use of credit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help manage counterparty exposure. We would be required to perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest payment. \\nTable 14.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives. \\nTable 14.7: Sold Credit Derivatives \\nNotional amount \\n(in millions) Protection sold Protection  sold  –  \\nnon-investment  \\ngrade \\nDecember 31, 2022 \\nCredit default swaps $ 12,733 1,860 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,728 6,518 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 19,461 8,378 \\nDecember 31, 2021 Credit default swaps $ 8,033 1,982 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,756 6,012 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 14,789 7,994 \\nProtection sold represents the estimated maximum \\nexposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of \\ndefault, the value of our interests and any associated collateral declined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of recovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from collateral held or any economic hedges. \\nThe amounts under non-investment grade represent the \\nnotional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets \\nunder the credit derivative have an external rating that is investment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify the credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit derivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order to achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk management is designed to provide an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold credit derivatives. \\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features \\nCertain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand additional collateral or require termination or replacement of derivative instruments in a net liability position. Table 14.8 illustrates our exposure to OTC bilateral derivative contracts with credit-risk contingent features, collateral we have posted, and the additional collateral we would be required to post if the credit rating of our debt was downgraded below investment grade. \\nTable 14.8: Credit-Risk Contingent Features \\n(in  billions) Dec 31,  \\n2022 Dec  31, \\n2021 \\nNet  derivative  liabilities  with  credit-risk  \\ncontingent  features $  20.7  12.2  \\nCollateral  posted 17.4  11.0  \\nAdditional  collateral  to  be  posted  upon  a  below  \\ninvestment  grade  credit  rating  (1) 3.3  1.2', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Note 15: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities\\n\\t\\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments \\nto certain assets and liabilities and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in Table 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities carried at amortized cost. \\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed description of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \\nAssets \\nTRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",

These securities are valued using internal trader prices that are subject to independent price verification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader prices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as prices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed trades, and other approved market data. These pricing services compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine if observable market information is being used versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an internal trader price, compared with other independent pricing sources, considerations include the range and quality of available information and observability of trade data. These sources are used to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. \\nWhen vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \\nadjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal models use discounted cash flow techniques or market comparable pricing techniques. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS) LHFS generally includes \\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. A majority of residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our trading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading business is based on pending transactions when available. Where market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \\nLOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that are based on the observable market price of the loan or current appraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs) Residential MSRs are', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",

We determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that estimates the present value of expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants may use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility for residential MSRs), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. \\nDERIVATIVES Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis.

Our remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for using the equity method, cost method or measurement alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar securities of the same issuer. \\nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value for such securities. We use all available information in making this determination, which includes observable transaction prices for the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, we make adjustments to observed market data to reflect the comparative differences between the market data and the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public companies and other investment-specific considerations like liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the instruments. \\nOTHER ASSETS Although other assets are generally recorded at \\namortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease ROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities.

Fair values for these instruments are estimated using a discounted cash flow model that includes both the embedded derivative and debt portions of the notes. The discount rate used in these discounted cash flow models also incorporates the impact of our credit spread, which is based on observable spreads in the secondary bond market. \\nLevel 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes \\nWe generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices obtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending on which approach is utilized. \\nINTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS Certain Level 3 fair value \\nestimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to historical experience and other third-party data where available. \\nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our \\nmodel risk management policies and procedures, which include model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, processing components, logic or theory, output results and supporting model documentation. Validation also includes ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate given observable market transactions or other market data within the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models continue to perform as expected, include: • ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions   \\n      \\nand other independent market data (including pricing        \\nvendors, if available);   \\n•\\t\\t back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized transactions; and \\n•\\t\\t review of modeled valuation results against expectations, including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in value. \\nWe update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \\nreflect these monitoring procedures.

       " Document(page_content='The internal valuation techniques used for our Level 3 assets \\nand liabilities, as presented in Table 15.3, are described as \\nfollows: •\\t\\t Discounted cash flow    – Discounted cash flow valuation      \\ntechniques generally consist of developing an estimate of         \\nfuture cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of             \\nan instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a           \\nrate of return that results in the fair value amount.          \\n•\\t\\t Market comparable pricing    – Market comparable pricing     \\nvaluation techniques are used to determine the fair value of           \\ncertain instruments by incorporating known inputs, such as         \\nrecent transaction prices, pending transactions, financial       \\nmetrics of comparable companies, or prices of other similar          \\ninvestments that require significant adjustment to reflect        \\ndifferences in instrument characteristics.    \\n•\\t\\t Option model  – Option model valuation techniques are \\ngenerally used for instruments in which the holder has a \\ncontingent right or obligation based on the occurrence of a future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going above or below a predetermined strike price. Option models estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return.  \\nThe unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \\nthose we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liabi\\nlity \\nwould be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation. Following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. •\\t\\t Comparability adjustment   – is an adjustment made to       \\nobserved market data, such as a transaction price to reflect           \\ndissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or ot        her  \\nfactors used within a market valuation approach, expressed         \\nas a percentage of an observed price.       \\n•\\t\\t Conversion factor   – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a    \\nparticular instrument may be exchanged for another instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage change from a specified rate. \\n•\\t\\t Correlation factor   – is the likelihood of one instrument   \\nchanging in price relative to another based on an established relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. \\n•\\t\\t Cost to service    – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a  \\nportfolio of loans, which includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing such loan portfolios. \\n•\\t\\t Default rate   – is an estimate of the likelihood of not   \\ncollecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a constant default rate (CDR). \\n•\\t\\t Discount rate   – is a rate of return used to calculate the', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 162}),\n",

The discount rate consists of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium \\ncomponent. The benchmark rate component, for example, OIS, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury rates, is generally observable within the market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. The risk premium component reflects the amount of compensation market participants require due to the         \\nuncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting         \\nfrom risks such as credit and liquidity.       \\n• Fall-out factor  \\n  – is the expected percentage of loans        \\nassociated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio         \\nthat are likely of not funding.      \\n• Initial-value servicing   – is the estimated value of the        \\nunderlying loan, including the value attributable to the         \\nembedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of         \\noutstanding unpaid principal balance.    \\n• Loss severity   – is the estimated percentage of contractual        \\ncash flows lost in the event of a default.         \\n• Multiples  – are financial ratios of comparable public        \\ncompanies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value           \\nof equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and         \\namortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value,         \\nadjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial,        or  \\nmarketability to the comparable public company used in a          \\nmarket valuation approach.   \\n• Prepayment rate   – is the estimated rate at which forecasted         \\nprepayments of principal of the related loan or debt          \\ninstrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant          \\nprepayment rate (CPR).   \\n• Volatility factor   – is the extent of change in price an item is            \\nestimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time          \\nexpressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a            \\nperiod over time.   \\n• Weighted average life    – is the weighted average number of        \\nyears an investment is expected to remain outstanding         \\nbased on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated          \\ndate the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the            \\ninstrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing          \\nof an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not          \\ncontractually fixed.  \\nInterrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in \\nRecurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \\nUsage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 15.3 requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. \\nCertain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a \\ndirectionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change in another input having a potentially muted impact to the overall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a change in one unobservable input may result in a change to another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify the fair value impact. \\nDEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE The internal models', metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/2022-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 162}),\n",

An increase in any of these unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the MSRs and alternatively, a decrease in any one of these inputs would result in the MSRs increasing in value.

We may elect the fair value option to align the measurement model with how the financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion of the portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS) LHFS measured at fair value include \\nresidential mortgage loan originations for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist to reliably support our valuations. Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, and related direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. We believe fair value measurement for LHFS reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. \\nAdditionally we purchase loans for market-making purposes \\nto support the buying and selling demands of our customers in our trading business. These loans are generally held for a short period of time and managed within parameters of internally approved market risk limits. Fair value measurement best aligns with our risk management practices. Fair value for these loans is generally determined using readily available market data based on recent transaction prices for similar loans. \\nLONG-TERM DEBT We have elected to account for certain \\nstructured debt liabilities under the fair value option.

The Board \\ndoes this directly and through its committees. \\nThe Board assesses senior management’s performance and holds senior management accountable for \\nmaintaining and adhering to an effective risk-management program. In addition, the Board engages in credible review and challenge of senior management assumptions, recommendations, and decisions as part of its oversight responsibilities. Oversight of management’s approach to climate-related risks and opportunities is \\npart of the Board’s role. In 2022, the Board received an update on risks related to climate change, including management's work to integrate climate-related risks into our risk and control infrastructure. \\nThe Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves the Wells Fargo Risk Management Framework, which sets \\nforth the Company’s core principles for managing and governing risk, including risks related to impacts from climate change. The Risk Management Framework is reviewed and updated annually, with many other documents and policies flowing from its core principles. The Risk Committee also oversees the Company’s adherence to our risk appetite. The Risk Committee supports the stature, authority, and independence of the Company’s Independent Risk Management function (which includes Climate Risk Oversight). \\nThe Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee \\nthe Company’s significant strategies, policies, and programs on social and public responsibility matters, including environmental sustainability and climate change. To facilitate its oversight of climate-related matters, the Corporate Responsibility Committee receives regular updates from our Chief Sustainability Officer and other leaders on matters such as climate-related finance and our goal of achieving net-zero GHG emissions, including financed emissions, by 2050. Other forms of Board engagement with climate-related risks and opportunities occur as needed and will continue to evolve as needs dictate. \\nFor further information on the oversight provided by the Board and its committees, please see the Committee \\nCharters, which can be found on our Leadership and Governance website .\", metadata={'source': '/Users/aryan/Desktop/fargowells/mlpoc/hackathon/sustainability-survey-automation/training-data/climate-disclosure.pdf', 'page': 12})]"
